'' virtual international authority file . catalog of works – german national library ( in german ) thomas dörflein ( <integer> october <year> – <integer> september <year> ) was a german zookeeper at the berlin zoological garden for <integer> years . after the baby polar bear knut was abandoned by his mother shortly after his birth in <year> , dörflein—who cared for both the zoo 's wolves and the bears—was assigned as the cub 's caretaker . as a result of the zoo 's decision to raise knut by hand , and the resultant close relationship between keeper and animal , dörflein became a reluctant celebrity . == early life and career == dörflein was born in berlin 's wedding neighborhood , but was raised in the city 's spandau district . he trained for three years to become a zookeeper , after which he took a job at the berlin zoo . at first he was responsible for the zoo 's apes , predators and cliff-dwelling animals , but in <year> he was put in charge of the bears and wolves . == knut == on <integer> december <year> , knut was found at a research island and was rushed to berlin zoo for treatment . the cubs ' mother rejected them for unknown reasons , abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear enclosure . zookeepers rescued the cubs by scooping them out of the enclosure with an extended fishing net , but knut 's brother died of an infection four days later . only the size of a guinea pig , knut spent the first <integer> days of his life in an incubator before dörflein began raising the cub . knut 's need for around-the-clock care required that dörflein sleep on a mattress next to knut 's sleeping crate at night , and play with , bathe , and feed the cub daily . knut 's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed with cod liver oil every two hours , before graduating at the age of four months to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins . dörflein also accompanied knut on his twice-daily one-hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub . as a result , dörflein became a minor celebrity in germany . he received fan mail , and even marriage proposals , all of which made him uncomfortable ; when asked about his sudden rise to fame , the zookeeper said , `` it 's very strange to me . `` <days> october <year> , dörflein was awarded berlin 's medal of merit in honor of his continuous care for the cub . several months beforehand , knut 's and dörflein 's daily shows had been halted when it was decided that knut had grown too large for the zookeeper to safely accompany him in the enclosure . with knut nearing his first birthday , his zookeeper was barred from physical contact with the bear . == death == dörflein died suddenly in berlin at the age of <integer> of a heart attack on <integer> september <year> . dörflein had been seriously ill for some time , and had recently taken some time from work after having been diagnosed with bladder cancer ; according to reports , he had gone into remission . he was survived by a stepdaughter , a son , and his girlfriend and her young son.berlin newspaper b.z . wrote of dörflein , `` everyone wanted to be like [ him ] ... he not only cared for knut ; he nurtured our desire to see harmony between man and beast . '' the berlin zoo , where dörflein was employed for <integer> years , released an official statement describing the death as tragic and a `` great loss '' . the group friends of the berlin zoo stated : `` with the passing of thomas dörflein , the zoo has lost a highly dedicated zookeeper who had great passion for his job and his calling . '' the statement went on to note how dörflein played a decisive role in turning berlin `` into a sensational attraction with the polar bear cub . '' zoo biologist heiner klös added : `` i am shocked by the passing of my best zookeeper , a man who gave his all for his animals . `` <days> january <year> , dörflein was the recipient of b.z . 's posthumous honorary award for bringing joy to berlin through his relationship with knut . the zoo established a prize for outstanding zookeepers in dörflein 's honour . the first thomas dörflein prize , which carries a €1,000 cash prize as well as a trophy , was awarded <days> june <year> . knut succeeded him in death on <integer> march <year> after collapsing in his enclosure , at the age of four . on december <days> , <year> , a memorial dedicated to knut was unveiled near dörflein 's grave in spandau , on what would have been the bear 's fifth birthday . == references == == external links == berlin zoo official website ralph hudson johnson frse ( <integer> december <year> – <integer> july <year> ) was a <other> british neurologist . == early life and education == he was born on <integer> december <year> in sunderland , tyne and wear the son of sydney reynald edward johnson , an electrical engineer , and his wife , phyllis . he attended lawrence sheriff school and then won a scholarship to rugby school . he won a double scholarship and obtained multiple degrees at both university of cambridge and university of oxford . == career == johnson completed his training at ucl medical school in london , in <year> . in <year> , he moved to the radcliffe infirmary in oxford , where he conducted research on artificial respiration for poliomyelitis and rehabilitation of paraplegics , winning awards from the polio research fund , british medical association and the schorstein medical research fellowship of oxford university.he was awarded multiple doctorates and honorary doctorates throughout his career . in <year> he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh . his proposers were john a simpson , robert martin stuart smellie , henry g morgan , and reginald passmore.in <year> , he went to the newly-created wellington clinical school of medicine in new zealand as its first dean . mixing research with organisational skills , he created a new diploma in community health in <year> . in <year> he returned to britain , taking up a fellowship at wadham college , oxford . == death == a keen apiarist , he died of anaphylactic shock after having been stung by a swarm of his own bees in his garden in oxford on <integer> july <year> . == publications == disorders of the automatic nervous system ( <year> ) with j m k spalding multiple sclerosis in scotland ( <year> ) neurocardiology ( <year> ) with lambie and spalding == family == in <year> , he married gillian s keith , a social worker . they had two children . == references == eerik kumari born erik mathias sits ( <integer> march <year> – <integer> january <year> ) was a biologist , and pioneer of ornithology and nature conservation in estonia . he was born in kirbla , lihula parish . he was a director of the institute of zoology and botany at the estonian academy of sciences during 1952–1977 . he was the president of the estonian naturalists ' society in 1954–1964 . the eerik kumari award was established in <year> in his name to honor those who have excelled in biology in estonia . == references == eerik kumari memorial collection sir thomas richard edmund southwood gom dl frs ( <integer> june <year> – <integer> october <year> ) was a british biologist , professor of zoology and vice-chancellor of the university of oxford . a specialist on entomology , he developed the field of insect ecology and the development of study techniques . he wrote a landmark textbook on ecological methods that went into numerous editions . he also was well known for developing the field of entomology through mentorship of a circle of researchers at silwood park . == biography == southwood was born in marlborough cottage in northfleet near gravesend where his father 's family dealt in farm and dairy products . in <year> the family moved to parrock manor . his parents encouraged his interest in natural history . richard became interested in natural history at an early age , and developed his skills on the family dairy farm in kent ; he had his first research article on sunbathing in birds in british birds when he was fifteen and about insects published in the entomologist 's monthly magazine when he was a year older . his father had received some education at the wye college . other early influences included tom longstaff . he was educated at bronte school , gravesend grammar school and imperial college london bsc in biology , msc botany , then worked for his phd degree in zoology studies at rothamsted experimental station . he returned to imperial as a research assistant and lecturer , and in <year> became head of the department of zoology and applied entomology , and director of imperial college 's field station at silwood park . he later became dean of science and chair of the division of life sciences.southwood 's research at imperial concentrated on insect communities and population dynamics . his <year> book ecological methods described techniques available for the study of populations and ecosystems , including population estimates with different sampling techniques.in <year> , he took up the linacre chair of zoology in the university of oxford , and was elected a fellow of merton college . in <year> , he moved from being head of the department of zoology to take up the vice-chancellorship of the university , from which position he set up a working party that would recommend the reform of the university 's governance . having stepped down from that position in <year> , he continued to research , teach and write , and in <year> published the story of life , a book based on the first-year undergraduate lectures he gave at oxford . southwood served as chairman of the royal commission on environmental pollution from <year> to <year> , having been first appointed to the commission in <year> . under his chairmanship , the <year> report lead in the environment aroused public concern about lead pollution . he was chairman of the national radiological protection board from <year> until <year> , and also chaired the working party on bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) set up by the british government in <year> . in 1993–1994 he was the first head of the department of environmental sciences and policy at the central european university in budapest . southwood was also a contributing member of the oxford round table , an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of contemporary issues . a portrait of sir richard southwood hangs at merton college , oxford . == family == sir richard southwood married , in <year> , alison langley ( née harden ) who he met at rothamsted ;

[ <integer> ] here anatoly did well at secondary school , gaining only excellent marks when he graduated in <year> . he immediately enrolled for the tashkent state technical university but was called up for military service almost immediately . [ <integer> ] whilst in the army his exceptional abilities brought him to the attention of kliment voroshilov who ordered him to enlist in the high artillery school in leningrad . in the end <days> june <year> kitov and his fellow students had to interrupt their learning and were urgently sent to the front . however kitov was already an officer , a lieutenant . later kitov became a commander of the whole anti-aircraft battery , with <integer> guns . intervals between battles anatoly kitov filled with studying mathematics and other university subjects . in <year> he performed his first analytic work , he proposed new method of anti aircraft shooting . that time he was at <integer> years old . kitov ’ s study of university subjects helped him gain <days> august <year> entry to the f.e . dzerzhinsky artillery academy ( one of the ussr best military universities ) to the faculty of rocket armament , skipping the first academic year so as to start in the second . a.i . kitov was the chairman of scientific society of the academy ’ s students . during his studing in the academy he himself was also working upon development of a rocket weapon of new type . the ussr state committee on inventions awarded him an `` author ’ s certificate on the invention '' ( patent ) . his project proposal on new rocket-type weapon , among other perspective military inventions , was subsequently reported to i.v . stalin – the soviet army supreme commander . also at that period a.i . kitov , still being a student of the academy , was involved in the work of s.p . korolev ’ s task force engaged in development of the soviet missile <other> . in <year> , a. kitrov graduated from the full course of the academy with honors and a gold medal . diversified scientific and organizational activity of anatoly i. kitov has the following <integer> milestones in his biography : === soviet military cybernetics initiatives === kitov was the first who implemented for the usage of the first computer ( the first soviet serial computer „ strela “ ) to the military ministry of the ussr.kitov was the first in the ussr to organise and to head scientific work on solving military problems with the use of electronic computers . those were calculations for general staff of the ussr armed forces , for the main intelligence directorate , for main directorate of the land forces , for directorate of support , etc . already in the mid-fifties kitov developed main principles of computerbased automated military-control and management systems for defence purposes . a big work was performed for implementing them in practical military usage . at the period between the years <year> and <year> kitov issued the fundamental and first in the ussr , series of scientific articles on military informatics ’ subjects . they were published by the journals `` military thought '' , `` radioelectronics '' , `` news of the f.e . dzerzhisky artillery academy '' , also by periodical collections of works at the ussr ministry of defence and other `` special '' ( classified ) sources . in the computer center no <integer> ministry of defense of the ussr kitov was always the main initiator – „ generator of ideas '' , who set up the problems and was „ the brain '' of their solution , and of the scientific projects in general '' . a. kitov is the founder of soviet military cybernetics . === first computer department in the ussr === in <year> , a.i . kitov founded and headed the first soviet `` department of computers '' at the artillery academy . those time it was called a department of mathematical machines . also , at <year> a. kitov created the ussr first scientific phd dissertation on programming with the subject `` programming of the outer ballistics problems for the long range missiles '' . in <year> , a.i . kitov published pioneer scientific article , on thirty pages , `` implementation and usage of electronic computers '' . that was the first article in the ussr on the subject . at <year> a.i . kitov founded the first computer centre in the ussr . it was the computer centre no <integer> of the ussr ministry of defence ( cc no <integer> md ussr , secret number <integer> ) and he was the first header of it . in may <days> <year> he was just <integer> , however enjoyed indisputable authority among his colleagues and subordinates . === creation of the ussr anti-missile defense system === ballistic calculations for strategic rocket forces and for support of the first space flights took special place in the cc №1 work . description of the architecture of `` <other> '' became a part of a.i . kitov ’ s thesis for doctor ’ s degree . the dissertation was titled `` implementation of computers for solving the problems of antiaircraft and antimissile defence . '' he brilliantly defended it in <year> , at the `` closed '' ( for authorised persons only ) meeting of the scientific council of the institute of management problems , as ussr . besides the `` <other> '' , in his dissertation research kitov has also analysed principles of designing specialised military computers . he defined specific features of their structure , algorithmic programming language for solving complex of anti-aerial defence problems with the use of computers , and performed computer modelling of dynamical systems connected with air defence systems demands . === cybernetics science in the ussr === from <year> to <year> , cybernetics was officially called bourgeois pseudoscience in the ussr . in <other> kitov read the book cybernetics by norbert wiener in english . he found this book in the library of the secret <other> . kitov not only realized the scientific and social value of cybernetics , but also wrote the first positive article in the ussr , `` the main features of cybernetics '' . it was very daring and could have ended with repressions for kitov . after all , joseph stalin was still alive . but kitov began the struggle for the recognition of cybernetics in the ussr . in <other> kitov lectured on cybernetics in well-known soviet organizations . kitov invited the venerable scientists sobolev and lyapunov to become co-authors of his article `` the main features of cybernetics '' . the article was published in the journal voprosy filosofii ( <year> , no . <integer> ) and for the first time presented the principles of cybernetics to the soviet audience . the victory for cybernetics was bolstered by the publication two months later of kitov 's article `` technical cybernetics '' in the popular technical monthly `` radio '' . in <other> , the scientific works of a.i . kitov played a significant role in the recognition of cybernetics as a science and in its development in the ussr and other socialist countries . === new computers development === at the cc №1 a.i . kitov headed and participated in design and manufacturing of two new computers - `` <other> '' and `` udar '' ( blow ) . both were successfully put into operation . computer `` <other> '' was processing data , which were received form surveillance radiolocation stations . `` udar '' was used at preparing ballistic missiles for launching . author ’ s certificate for invention given to a.i . kitov with his three colleagues with priority on <integer> june <year> for the principle of the parallel processing of instructions , . created by kitov this principle of statements parallel processing by the arithmetic device of computer , which is famous as `` conveyor processing '' is still in use by modern computers . kitov proposed to implement this principle at the cc no <integer> , where it was used for new computer `` <other> '' , which was developed under kitov ’ s guidance . that time it was the quickest lamp computer ( first generation ) in the ussr and in the world – one hundred thousand computer instructions per second . in `` <other> '' one of the first immediate access stores on ferrite cores were used . its two level addressing of operating memory device ( cash-memory ) was important factor of increasing its performance . there were also some other principle novelties , but they were classified , as the whole project was a secret one . special department of mathematical support had been established by kitov for designing computer `` <other> '' . besides `` <other> '' , in cc no <integer> for this computer was created a huge amount of software for processing information coming from radars of the soviet anti-aircraft defence systems . === writing on programming , computers and their applications === the books by a.i . kitov became a part of history of national science and university education as the first most complete sources on computer sciences , programming and automated management systems . kitov was the author of the first soviet book ( <year> ) and first soviet text-book ( <year> ) on programming , computers and their applications . in common , he published <integer> scientific books translated at <integer> foreign languages . kitov 's books brought to general readers information and knowledge about the birth of new it-branch . === pioneering the automated management systems === in his first soviet computer book digital electronic machines ( <year> ) kitov published a big part „ non-arithmetic usage of computers '' . large chapter of this book is dedicated to usage of computers in economy , automation of production processes and at solving other intellectual problems . in his another book „ electronic computing machines '' , released in <year> , kitov describes in details perspectives of complex automation in management , including management of industrial production and solving of economic problems . anatoly kitov is the author of the notion `` automated management systems - ams '' and also of the philosophy of the soviet `` ams '' . in his `` programming information and logic tasks '' ( <year> ) kitov presents `` associative programming '' technology – method for solving information-logical problems with large data-arrays processing . programming language algem , created under a.i . kitov 's scientific guidance , was described . algem was used in the ussr and in the socialist countries of the east europe . in his next book `` programming of economical and management tasks '' a.i . kitov generalised experience of his work as the chief designer of the automated management system ( ams ) for the ministry of radio-industry . that system was recognised as the basic model for amses for the other nine ministries of the ussr weapon industry . the book presented basic principles of creation automated management systems for the plants and industry . === computer networking for the national economy management ( project `` red book '' ) === a.i . kitov was the first one to demonstrate necessity of creation of national automated system for management in the state economy and – simultaneously – in the armed forces , on basis of full-scale usage of electronic computers and mathematical methods . clear understanding of the ams development importance led kitov , at the end of <year> , to the conclusion about necessity of automatisation of management of the national economy and also of its armed forces . the main point was , that this automated management system should be based on national network of regional computer centres ( project `` red book '' ) . a.i . kitov is famous for being the first one in the world who suggested project of an global integrated computer network for automated management of both the ussr national economy and the armed forces , functioning of which would be based on computers and mathematical methods . he proposed that technological structure of that system would be a global , double purpose , computer network , covering the whole ussr territory . this network should consist of hundreds of computer centres maintained by specially qualified military personnel . in autumn of <year> a.i . kitov sent his second letter with his project of global computer network ( the project `` red book '' ) to the leader of ussr n.s . khrushchev . === information retrieval systems === typical example of kitov ’ s scientific intuition consisted in his opinion on information retrieval systems . he aimed efforts of his cc №1 scientists at their development . creation of information retrieval systems became really `` pioneer direction '' not only for the ussr armed forces but for the whole soviet it as well . anatoly kitov initiated scientific works at the cc №1 on the mathematical linguistics and machine translation . kitov proposed to concentrate basic efforts not on direct increasing of performance , but first on development of methods , algorithms and programs which permitted to essentially extend processing , storage and retrieval semantic information . === theory and practice of algorithmic programming languages === a. kitov is the creator of two algorithmic programming languages - algem and normin . compared with <other> , algem was completed with new types of data , which made possible processing of not only numerical but also text-based information and data groups of various types . during a long time algem was a `` working horse '' for the soviet programmers , who were working in the field `` non-arithmetical '' applications of computers , it was also used in numerous ams of various levels implemented in industry and administrative management structures , both in the ussr and in the socialist countries . in the <other> while working as the chief-designer of the ams ‘ healthcare ’ , a.i . kitov developed algorithmic programming language normin , which was widely used in the ussr for programming medical problems . that was the first , in the ussr , query language for the information retrieval on formalised natural language . taking under consideration that medical ams would be used by the people , who didn ’ t have special technical education kitov implemented special interface in his systems , which was convenient and easily understandable on intuition level as much as it was possible at the level of computer development of that time . the interface realised , among others , dialogue mode `` human – computer '' in normalised natural language normin . === computers unification and standardisation === already in his letter to n.s . khrushchev , from 07.01.1959 , kitov insisted that introduction of automated systems in the country should be conducted under supervision of the state administrator of high level – such as the member of the political-bureau of the central committee of the communist party . the whole work in the field of computation means and automated management systems should be subjected to a single body of the soviet union state level –special ministry- which would be granted the monopoly to coordinate , control and implement all developments and achievements of that branch . `` only such organisation will grant successful progress , rational , without time-delays or senseless chaotic actions '' . in his article ‘ computers – assistants in each thing ’ from <integer> july <year> , a.i . kitov declares , that : `` taking under consideration exceptional importance of the computer development for the national economy and for the state defence , and also considering the fact that production of these computation means is steadily increasing , the need in centralised control over the work of computation centres of all kinds and categories and in control and coordination of usage of single computers , belonging to various organisations , is getting clear . these measures will enable the most rational usage of computers in interests of the whole country '' . all that , kitov wanted to perform on the whole national scale , and wrote about it in many of his articles . unfortunately , all those ideas and proposals hadn ’ t been heard and the bureaucratic machine was too slow . === projects in medical cybernetics === a.i . kitov has worked at health care and medicine more than ten years . in the 1970s a.i . kitov created for medical industry ams `` health care '' and became a recognised leader in this field both in the ussr and abroad . kitov managed to solve important scientific problems : information model of the soviet medical industry was created , unified software packages for forming and logical control of information arrays were worked out . in fact , during his `` medical period '' a.i . kitov started scientific research practically from the zero point and moved medical informatics of the ussr several tens of years ahead . within the healthcare field he established scientific school , brought up number of talented followers , number of dissertation works were completed under his guidance . he also published several conceptual articles and three monographs : `` automation of information processing and management in the healthcare field '' ( <year> ) . `` introduction into medical cybernetics '' ( <year> ) and `` medical cybernetics '' ( <year> ) . a.i . kitov made great contribution to creation of `` local '' medical amses , which functioned within specific enterprises – at hospitals , clinics , drugstores . the first ams of that type operated at the clinical hospital no <integer> subjected to the third directorate of the ussr ministry of health . later this ams supported a great deal of work at curing and rehabilitation of victims of chernobyl power station catastrophe of <year> . even there he managed to be a pioneer – the founder of soviet medical cybernetics . during <integer> years a.i . kitov was the national representative of the ussr at influential organisations in the field of medical informatics at the united nations and the unesco : • international federation of medical informatics : ( medinfo ) . • international medical informatics association : officer of imia . • technical committee no4 of international federation for information processing ( <other> ifip ) . he participated in organization of three international congresses med-info : ist world congress of medinfo – <year> ( stokholm ) , iind world congress of medinfo – <year> ( toronto ) , iiird world congress of medinfo – <year> ( tokyo ) . a.i . kitov at these congresses was the member of organizing committee and programm committee . about a thousand scientists from developed countries gathered at <other> . a.i . kitov was a chairman of the section on biomedical researches ( session t2 – « biomedical research general » ) . === pedagogical activity === pedagogical activity took important place in a.i . kitov ’ s work . as it is clearly visible from his biography , he had born interest for acquiring knowledge and their dissemination ; passing them to those who surrounded him . for great many of it specialists a.i . kitov is famous , first of all , as the author of the first soviet books and textbooks on computing and programming . else at the 1951–1952 , at the artillery academy name f.e . dzerzhinsky a.i . kitov conducted one of the three , first in the ussr , courses of lectures on computers and programming . more than <integer> post graduates , both soviet and foreign , prepared and defended dissertations under kitov ’ s scientific supervision . in <year> , when a.i . kitov already had rich experience of scientific work and of teaching , he received position at the russian g.v . plekhanov university of economics , where he worked during seventeen years . he headed the chair of „ computer engineering and programming '' . ==

<year> ) was a british scientist who was a leading figure in developmental biology . her work helped lead to human in vitro fertilisation ( ivf ) , and she received many honours for her contributions to science , including election as fellow of the royal society . == early life == mclaren was the daughter of sir henry mclaren , 2nd baron aberconway , a former liberal mp , and christabel mary melville macnaghten . she was born in london and lived there until the outbreak of world war ii , when her family moved to their estate at bodnant , north wales . as a child she appeared in the film version of h.g . wells ' novel things to come , released in <year> . she was entitled to be referred to as `` the honourable anne mclaren '' .she read zoology at lady margaret hall , oxford , later gaining an ma . researching mite infestation of drosophila under j.b.s . haldane , she continued her post-graduate studies at university college london from <year> , first under peter medawar on the genetics of rabbits and then on neurotropic murine viruses under kingsley sanders . she obtained her dphil in <year> and married fellow student dr donald michie on <integer> october <year> . == early career and married life == as a couple , mclaren and donald michie worked together at university college london from <year> to <year> , and afterwards at the royal veterinary college , on the variation in the number of lumbar vertebrae in mice as a function of maternal environment . mclaren would later take up research on fertility in mice , including superovulation and superpregnancy . in <year> , she published a landmark nature paper with john d. biggers reporting the first successful development and birth of mice embryos that were first recovered from naturally fertilized females at the 8–16 cells stage , then cultured in vitro for two days until the blastocyst stage , and finally transferred back to females ' uterus until birth . this paper entitled `` successful development and birth of mice cultivated in vitro as early embryos '' has been called `` one of the most significant papers in the history of reproductive biology and medicine '' .during this period , she also had three children : susan michie ( born <integer> june <year> ) jonathan michie ( born <integer> march <year> ) caroline michie ( born in <year> ) however , the marriage ended in divorce in <year> , and mclaren moved to the institute of animal genetics in edinburgh to continue her research . the couple remained on good terms ; michie also moved to edinburgh . the experience of raising children as a single career parent made mclaren a strong advocate for government assistance towards childcare . == later career == mclaren spent the next <integer> years ( 1959–1974 ) at the institute of animal genetics , studying a variety of topics related to fertility , development and epigenetics , including the development of mouse embryonic transfer , immunocontraception , and the skeletal characteristics of chimerae.in <year> , she left edinburgh to become the director of the mrc mammalian development unit in london . in <year> , she retired from the unit and moved to cambridge , joining the wellcome/crc institute , later the gurdon institute . she was made a fellow-commoner of christ 's college , cambridge in 1991.mclaren 's work often took her outside the university . she

council on bioethics , 1991–2000.in <year> , mclaren was one of the co-founders of the frozen ark project , along with husband and wife bryan and ann clarke . the project 's aim is `` saving the dna and viable cells of the world 's endangered species '' .in her later life , she was a member of the communist party of great britain , which made travel to the usa difficult for a while . == honours == in <year> , mclaren was made a fellow of the royal society . from <year> to <year> , she held the position of foreign secretary of the royal society and from <year> to <year> the position of

антонович івашко , volodymyr antonovych ivashko ; <integer> october <year> – <integer> november <year> ) was a soviet ukrainian politician , briefly acting as general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union ( cpsu ) during the period from <integer> to <integer> august <year> . on <integer> august mikhail gorbachev resigned from the post , and on <integer> august the cpsu was suspended by the supreme soviet . before becoming general secretary he had been voted gorbachev 's deputy general secretary within the party on <integer> july <year> , a newly created position as a result of the 28th congress of the communist party . == background == the communist party of the soviet union ( cpsu ) during the time between mikhail gorbachev 's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent . by the time of the 28th congress <days> july <year> , the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had , across the fifteen republics of the soviet union , split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the soviet state . stripped of its leading role in society , the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united . actual political power lay in the positions of president of the soviet union ( held by gorbachev ) and president of the russian sfsr ( held by boris yeltsin ) . during the august coup he did not make public statements but on behalf of the secretariat distributed letters to local party organizations calling on them to uphold the cpsu . gorbachev brought in his ally ivashko in to replace the long-serving volodymyr shcherbytsky as first secretary of the ukrainian communist party on <integer> september <year> . ivashko led the communists to victory in the first relatively free parliamentary election held in the ukrainian ssr , which took place from <integer> march <days> <integer> march <year> , the communists winning <integer> seats to the democratic bloc 's <integer> seats . ivashko was elected by the communist majority to the post of the chairman of the verkhovna rada of the ukrainian ssr on <integer> june <year> . since the abandonment by the communists of their `` leading role '' in early <year> this position now superseded that of first secretary of the communist party as the most powerful position in ukraine . he resigned his position as first secretary on <integer> june <year> following opposition demonstrations against his simultaneous occupation of both the posts of first secretary of the ruling party and chairman of the legislature . however , on <integer> july <year> he too resigned as chairman of the verkhovna rada of the ukrainian ssr after declining to be recalled to kyiv during the 28th congress of the communist party in moscow , and a few days later successfully secured the position of deputy general secretary of the cpsu . on august <days> , <year> , a secret memorandum from ivashko outlined strategies to hide the communist party 's assets through russian and international joint ventures because boris yeltsin , who was the new president of the russian republic in the soviet union , wanted to levy taxes on the communist party 's vast administrative property holdings and on the party itself . the memorandum was to organize the transfer of cpsu funds , cpsu financing and support of its operations through associations , ventures , foundations , etc . which are to act as invisible economics . <days> november <year> , the offshore structure fimaco was formed by the russian central bank , then known as gosbank , to hide these funds . according to sergei tretyakov , kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov sent us $ <integer> billion worth of funds of the communist party to an unknown location in the lead-up to the collapse of the ussr.ivashko retired in <year> and died on <integer> november <year> , at the age of <integer> , after an undetermined long illness . == notes == == references == == sources == == external links == volodymyr ivashko in the encyclopedia of history of ukraine gerald stanley clark ( <integer> may <year> <days> june <year> ) was a new zealand sailor , writer and ornithologist . he is notable for his ornithological research work on subantarctic islands and for his circumnavigation of antarctica in his self-built yacht totorore . == early years == clark was born in colchester , england , and educated at boarding school and later at the thames nautical training college , then known as hms worcester . in <year> , unable to join the royal navy because of a visual defect , he joined the british merchant navy , serving with the union-castle line on the liberty ship samflora , and completing his cadet training during a two-year cruise without home leave . upon discharge from the samflora he joined the straits steamship company , based in singapore , as a junior officer on small ships trading through the islands of south east asia.in <year> clark returned to england to attend the warsash maritime centre at southampton to sit for his master 's certificate . while he was there he married marjorie ellen bates who later joined him in singapore , where the couple had four daughters . there clark was promoted first to captain and then to assistant marine superintendent of a fleet of fifty vessels . == new zealand == in <year> clark and his family moved to kerikeri in new zealand , where he bought the homelands orchard . although they struggled at first , eventually they successfully pioneered the organic farming of citrus and sub-tropical fruits in the area.clark also attended evening classes in boat building , building his first yacht , the <integer> m ketiga in <year> , in which he took part in the first single-handed trans-tasman yacht race in <year> . in <year> he sailed around new zealand , including the chatham , auckland and campbell islands . === the totorore expedition === the totorore expedition was conceived as a circum-antarctic voyage to study the seabirds of the southern ocean in order to further their conservation . clark spent seven years building the <integer> m yacht totorore ( the maori name for the antarctic prion ) of kauri timber , completing and launching her in 1982.the totorore left kerikeri on <integer> february <year> , eventually returning on <integer> november <year> , <integer> years , <integer> months and <integer> days later , having travelled some 71,000 km eastwards , around and about the southern ocean and the antarctic peninsula , visiting numerous islands to survey and count seabirds . the most significant ornithological work was carried out in southern chile where new colonies of several species were discovered , and in south georgia where comprehensive and accurate counts were made of wandering albatrosses and king penguins along the long coastline . during much of the expedition clark was accompanied and aided by one or two companions , but sometimes , as on a late leg of the voyage between marion island and fremantle , australia , he was alone and frequently imperilled by rough seas and equipment failure.following his return , honours received by clark included : <year> – blue water trophy ( northland harbour board ) <year> – tillman medal for cruising in high latitudes ( royal cruising club of great britain ) <year> – blue water medal ( cruising club of america ) <year> – member of the order of the british empire , for services to ornithology , in the <year> queen 's birthday honours <year> – tequila propeller award ( royal akarana yacht club ) <year> – fred norris medal ( devonport yacht club ) <year> – stolberger memorial award ( new zealand yacht club navigators society ) <year> – fellow of the royal geographical societyfor the next twelve years clark continued his interest in seabird conservation and new zealand 's subantarctic islands by making numerous trips in the totorore to assist researchers from the department of conservation to count , map , and study seabirds . it was in the course of an expedition to recover satellite transmitters , used to track albatrosses breeding on the antipodes islands , that the totorore disappeared on about <integer> june <year> off the south coast of antipodes island , along with clark and his companion roger sale . == publications == clark wrote a book , based upon extracts from his diary , about the totorore expedition `` the totorore voyage ' ’ first published in <year> by century hutchinson , auckland . he also produced reports and published papers in

'' merton howard miller ( may <days> , <year> – june <days> , <year> ) was an american economist , and the co-author of the modigliani–miller theorem ( <year> ) , which proposed the irrelevance of debt-equity structure . he shared the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences in <year> , along with harry markowitz and william f. sharpe . miller spent most of his academic career at the university of chicago 's booth school of business . == biography == === early years === miller was born in boston , massachusetts to jewish parents sylvia and joel miller , a housewife and attorney . he attended harvard university as an undergraduate student . he worked during world war ii as an economist in the division of tax research of the treasury department , and received a ph.d. in economics from johns hopkins university , <year> . his first academic appointment after receiving his doctorate was visiting assistant lecturer at the london school of economics . === career === in <year> , at carnegie institute of technology ( now carnegie mellon university ) , he collaborated with his colleague franco modigliani on the paper the cost of capital , corporate finance and the theory of investment . this paper urged a fundamental objection to the traditional view of corporate finance , according to which a corporation can reduce its cost of capital by finding the right debt-to-equity ratio . according to the modigliani–miller theorem , on the other hand , there is no right ratio , so corporate managers should seek to minimize tax liability and maximize corporate net wealth , letting the debt ratio chips fall where they will . the way in which they arrived at this conclusion made use of the `` no arbitrage '' argument , i.e . the premise that any state of affairs that will allow traders of any market instrument to create a riskless money machine will almost immediately disappear . they set the pattern for many arguments based on that premise in subsequent years . miller wrote or co-authored eight books . he became a fellow of the econometric society in <year> and was president of the american finance association in <year> . he was on the faculty of the university of chicago 's booth school of business from <year> until his retirement in <year> , although he continued teaching at the school for several more years . his works formed the basis of the `` modigliani-miller financial theory '' . he served as a public director on the chicago board of trade 1983–85 and the chicago mercantile exchange from <year> until his death in chicago on june <days> , <year> . in <year> , miller waded into the controversy surrounding $ <integer> billion in trading losses by what was characterized as a rogue futures trader at a subsidiary of metallgesellschaft , arguing in the wall street journal that management of the subsidiary was to blame for panicking and liquidating the position too early . in <year> , miller was engaged by nasdaq to rebut allegations of price fixing . === personal life === miller was married to eleanor miller , who died in <year> . he was survived by his second wife , katherine miller , and by three children from his first marriage : pamela ( <year> ) , margot ( <year> ) , and louise ( <year> ) , and two grandsons . == bibliography == merton h. miller ( <year> ) . merton miller on derivatives . new york : john wiley & sons . isbn <days> . merton h. miller ( <year> ) . financial innovations and market volatility . cambridge , ma : blackwell publishing . isbn <days> . merton , miller h. ;

the golden pheasant and the lady amherst 's pheasant . he wrote numerous letters and articles on the subject of these two birds . he even resigned from the royal society for the protection of birds to protest its perceived lack of support for saving these pheasants , which had been introduced to parts of rural england . unlike most ornithologists and bird watchers , goodwin supported the plight of introduced bird species in britain and elsewhere . however , he did not support the reintroduction of raptor species , even regarding the white-tailed eagle as a potential danger to other species.derek goodwin died on <integer> may <year> , at the age of <integer> . == selected works == crows of the world ( <year> ) pigeons and doves of the world ( <year> ) estrildid finches of the world ( <year> ) birds in man ’ s world == references == peter thomas bauer , baron bauer , fba ( <integer> november <year> – <integer> may <year> ) was a hungarian-born british development economist . bauer is best remembered for his opposition to the widely-held notion that the most effective manner to help developing countries advance is through state-controlled foreign aid . == life == bauer was born péter tamás bauer in budapest , austria-hungary , in <year> . his family was jewish . he studied law in budapest before embarking for england in <year> to study economics at gonville and caius college , cambridge , from which he graduated in <year> . after a brief period in the private sector working for guthrie & co. , a london-based merchant house that conducted business in the far east , bauer spent most of his career at the london school of economics . bauer started teaching there in <year> and retired in <year> as emeritus professor of economics . with the support of his friend and admirer prime minister margaret thatcher , he was created a life peer as baron bauer , of market ward in the city of cambridge on <integer> february <year> . lord bauer was also a fellow of the british academy and a member of the mont pelerin society , which was founded by his friend friedrich hayek . in <year> , bauer received an honorary doctoral degree at universidad francisco marroquin for his contributions to economics . in <year> , he won the friedman prize for advancing liberty ; as part of his award , the cato institute cited his courage in espousing an approach almost universally opposed in post-world war ii international economic circles . bauer told london 's daily telegraph : `` i am truly honoured . i have long admired the cato institute and milton friedman , and recognition by both could not be more delightful . `` he died in london , england , on <integer> may <year> . == contributions to economics == nearly all of bauer 's contributions concerned development economics , international development and foreign aid . bauer sought to convince other development experts that central planning , foreign aid , price controls , and protectionism perpetuate poverty rather than eliminate it , and that the growth of government intervention politicises economic life and reduces individual freedom.bauer influenced thinking about the determinants of economic advance . for example , the world bank , in its <year> world development report , reflected the point of view bauer had been advocating for years , stating that the notion that `` good advisers and technical experts would formulate good policies , which good governments would then implement for the good of society '' was outdated : the institutional assumptions implicit in this world view were , as we all realize today , too simplistic ... . governments embarked on fanciful schemes . private investors , lacking confidence in public policies or in the steadfastness of leaders , held back . powerful rulers acted arbitrarily . corruption became endemic . development faltered , and poverty endured . for bauer , the essence of development was the expansion of individual choices , and the role of the state to protect life , liberty and property so that individuals can pursue their own goals and desires . limited government , not central planning , was his mantra . he argued that `` the exponents of western guilt ... patronize the third world by suggesting that its economic fortunes past , present , and prospective , are determined by the west ; that past exploitation by the west explains third world backwardness ... and that ( their ) economic future depends largely on western donations . `` bauer placed himself in the tradition of libertarians . in his many articles and books , including dissent on development , bauer overturned many of the commonly held beliefs of development economics . he refuted the idea that poverty is self-perpetuating and showed that central planning and large-scale public investment are not preconditions for growth . he criticised the idea that the disadvantaged could not and would not save for the future , or that they had no motivation to improve their condition . he opposed `` compulsory saving , '' which he preferred to call `` special taxation , '' and , like modern supply-side economists , stressed the detrimental effects of high taxes on economic activity . bauer also saw that government-directed investment funded by `` special taxation '' would increase `` inequality in the distribution of power . `` bauer 's experiences in malaya ( now west malaysia ) in the late 1940s and in west africa influenced his views on the importance of individual effort by small landowners and traders in moving from subsistence to a higher standard of living . bauer recognised the importance of the informal sector and advocated the `` dynamic gains '' from international trade – that is , the net gains that result from exposure to new ideas , new methods of production , new products , and new people . he demonstrated that trade barriers , and restrictive immigration and population policies deprive countries of those gains . for bauer , government-to-government aid was neither necessary nor sufficient for development , and may actually hinder it . the danger of aid , according to bauer , is that it increases the power of government , leads to corruption , misallocates resources , and erodes civil society . bauer also debunked what ralph raico has termed the `` timeless approach '' to history . a person commits this fallacy when he ignores the various events and preconditions which existed before and acted as prerequisites for the event or state of affairs being analysed . quoting raico : `` rejecting the 'timeless approach ' to economic development , bauer has accentuated the many centuries required for economic growth in the western world , and the interplay of various cultural factors that were its precondition '' == major works == bauer , p. t.

for portraying prominent historical scientists during some of his lectures ; dressing in costume and speaking in character to entertain and inform his students . a <year> guggenheim fellow , he wrote several books and more than <integer> scientific papers . his research focused on eyes and vision in animals , especially the parietal eye or `` third eye '' of vertebrates , as well as animal embryology . he served as chairman of the uc berkeley department of zoology for over <integer> years , was elected president of the western society of naturalists and american society of zoologists , and was a fellow of the california academy of sciences . eakin was born in florence , colorado , and grew up in tulsa , oklahoma . he initially studied at the university of tulsa , planning a career in the clergy , before switching to zoology , earning a bachelor 's degree and doctorate at uc berkeley . after postdoctoral studies in germany under hans spemann he returned to uc berkeley as a faculty member , where he would teach for over <integer> years , earning awards and recognition for his teaching before retiring with highest faculty honors . == early life and education ( 1910–1936 ) == richard eakin was born on may <days> , <year> , in florence , colorado , to parents marshall and mary elizabeth eakin . he attended high school in tulsa , oklahoma , graduating in <year> . he initially planned to go into the clergy , enrolling in the university of tulsa and studying subjects such as theology and greek for two years , before deciding to pursue zoology.in <year> , eakin moved to berkeley , california to attend uc berkeley . he earned his a.b . in <year> , then enrolled in graduate school under j. franklin daniel , an ichthyologist and embryologist . for his dissertation , eakin studied the development of salamander and frog embryos , earning a phd in zoology in <year> . from <year> to <year> he worked in germany as a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratories of embryologists otto mangold and nobel laureate hans spemann.on august <days> , <year> , eakin married mary mulford , daughter of walter mulford , a berkeley professor of forestry . == career ( 1936–1977 ) == upon his return to uc berkeley in <year> , eakin was appointed instructor of zoology , becoming assistant professor in <year> and full professor in <year> . he was assistant dean of the college of letters and science from <year> to <year> , and chairman of the department of zoology from <year> to <year> , and again from <year> to <year> . as an administrator he helped found the university 's bodega marine laboratory , sagehen creek field station , and cancer research genetics laboratory . in <year> he published a history of zoological research at berkeley spanning the period from the university 's <year> founding through <year> , followed by a <year> companion article covering the intervening <integer> years . === research === eakin was known for his research of animal eyes and photoreceptor cells , especially the parietal eye ( the so-called `` third eye '' ) and associated pineal gland of vertebrates . he was persuaded to study the parietal eyes of reptiles by his colleague robert c. stebbins , and the two published several articles on the parietal eye of western fence lizards . eakin , alone or with colleagues , published many other papers on the anatomy and function of reptilian parietal eyes and similar structures in amphibians . eakin 's <year> monograph , the third eye , was received as comprehensive and detailed enough for biologists , yet in a style approachable to non-scientists or undergraduates . he also studied amphibian development and was recognized as a skilled and early practitioner of electron microscopy . eakin received a guggenheim fellowship in <year> , and the boston museum of science 's walker prize in <year> . he authored or co-authored over <integer> scientific papers , was elected president of the western society of naturalists in <year> and american society of zoologists in <year> , and was a fellow of the california academy of sciences for <integer> years . === `` great scientists speak again '' === in <year> , in order to combat boredom and absenteeism in his introductory zoology course , eakin gave his first lecture in character , appearing unannounced in full costume and makeup as william harvey , the <other> physician who made the first complete descriptions of blood circulation . his portrayals of historic scientists , including charles darwin , louis pasteur , and gregor mendel , often involved elaborate wigs , makeup , costumes , and props , aided by professional makeup artists and drama teachers- his portrayal of darwin required up to three hours of makeup , wig , and beard preparation . his lectures were popular with students from the start and attracted international attention , with profiles in publications such as life , der spiegel , and the international herald tribune . he gave guest lectures at universities nationwide , and in <year> compiled the text of his lectures , along with photographs , diagrams , and stage directions , into a book , great scientists speak again . eakin typically gave six lectures in character during a course , with each `` guest lecturer '' introducing particular concepts . the figures portrayed , in order of appearance during a typical course , were : william harvey ( 1578–1657 ) william beaumont ( 1785–1853 ) hans spemann ( 1869–1941 ) gregor mendel ( 1822–1884 ) louis pasteur ( 1822–1895 ) charles darwin ( 1809–1882 ) eakin considered his impersonation of spemann to be his most authoritative , due to knowing him personally from working in his lab in germany , helping translate a book of his into english , and becoming good friends.eakin was recognized for his teaching long before he first donned a wig : in <year> he was the first recipient of berkeley 's senior citation for distinguished teaching and in <year> received the outstanding teaching award from the associated students of the university of california . == later years ( 1977–1999 ) == eakin retired in <year> and was honored with the berkeley citation , the highest honor given to berkeley faculty . he continued to periodically perform his lectures in character until <year> , and also taught embryology at several historically black colleges and universities in the southern u.s. , including tougaloo college , mississippi ; talladega college and tuskegee university , alabama ; and fisk university in tennessee.eakin was a member of the first congregational church of berkeley for over <integer> years , where his first wife , mary mulford eakin – ordained by the united church of christ – was

qualified as a chartered accountant which he practiced for the rest of his life while still pursuing his main interest as an ornithologist.clarke was said to have been 'vaguely interested in birds from his youth ' but he was keener on playing lead guitar in a rock band until hearing damage ended his musical career . it was in fact a love of angling that steered him towards ornithology . in <year> he moved to reach to fish pike and bream and would watch hen harriers hunting over the landscape . == ornithological work == two years later he teamed up with the artist donald watson to develop the uk hen harrier winter roost survey . the thesis for clarke 's phd in biological sciences , awarded by the university of liverpool in <year> , was on bird of prey feeding ecology.working for the university of aberdeen , clarke focused on orkney hen harrier feeding . he also contributed to the controversial joint raptor study langholm project , studying the predation of red grouse by hen harriers and peregrine falcons in southwest scotland 's border country.clarke 's reputation took him to india to study the world 's largest harrier roosts for the bombay natural history society . he subsequently worked on a project that successfully reintroduced red kites to several english regions.clarke 's first book , harriers of the british isles , appeared in <year> . it was followed by the marsh harrier ( <year> ) and montagu 's harrier ( <year> ) . he was co-editor of biology and conservation of small falcons in <year> and during the final months before his early death he worked on

( at the same time , american physicists discovered dancoff 's error and solved qed , relying less directly on dancoff . ) during the second world war , dancoff worked on the theory of the newly invented nuclear reactors . to take into account how fuel rods could `` shadow '' other rods by absorbing neutrons headed toward the other rods , he and m. ginsburg developed the dancoff factor , still used in reactor calculations.after the war , dancoff was on the faculty of the university of illinois at urbana-champaign . in <year> he published an approximation method for many-body theory that has been used in nuclear and solid-state physics . igor tamm had found it in <year> , and the method is now named after both . in the late 1940s , dancoff began a collaboration with the viennese-refugee physician and radiologist henry quastler in the new field of cybernetics and information theory . their work led to the publication of what is now commonly called dancoff 's law . a non-mathematical statement of this law is , `` the greatest growth occurs when the greatest number of mistakes are made consistent with survival '' .dancoff died of lymphoma in <year> . == references == horace waring ( <integer> december <year> – <integer> august <year> ) was an english/australian zoologist , winner of the clarke medal of the royal society of new south wales in 1962.waring was born in toxteth park , liverpool , england , and was educated at the university of liverpool ( b.sc. , <year> ; m.sc. , <year> ) . he was appointed the head of the department of zoology at the university of birmingham in <year> . on <integer> may <year> , waring was appointed professor of zoology at the university of western australia.waring 's field of research was in reproductive physiology , particularly the immunological competence and endocrine function of the development of the pouched embryo.he was awarded the mueller medal by anzaas in <year> . == references == william donald hamilton ( <integer> august <year> – <integer> march <year> ) was a british evolutionary biologist , widely recognised as one of the most significant evolutionary theorists of the 20th century.hamilton became famous through his theoretical work expounding a rigorous genetic basis for the existence of altruism , an insight that was a key part of the development of the gene-centered view of evolution . he is considered one of the forerunners of sociobiology . hamilton also published important work on sex ratios and the evolution of sex . from <year> to his death in <year> , he was a royal society research professor at oxford university . == early life == hamilton was born in <year> in cairo , egypt , the second of seven children . his parents were from new zealand ; his father a. m. hamilton was an engineer , and his mother b. m. hamilton was a medical doctor . the hamilton family settled in kent . during the second world war , the young hamilton was evacuated to edinburgh . he had an interest in natural history from an early age and spent his spare time collecting butterflies and other insects . in <year> , he discovered e. b. ford 's new naturalist book butterflies , which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection , genetics , and population genetics . he was educated at tonbridge school , where he was in smythe house . as a <other> , he was seriously injured while playing with explosives his father had that were left over from making hand grenades for the home guard during world war ii . hamilton had to have a thoracotomy and fingers on his right hand had to be amputated in king 's college hospital to save his life . he was left with scarring and needed six months to recover . before going up to the university of cambridge , he travelled in france and completed two years of national service . as an undergraduate at st. john 's college , he was uninspired by the `` many biologists [ who ] hardly seemed to believe in evolution '' . he was intrigued by ronald fisher 's book the genetical theory of natural selection , but fisher lacked standing at cambridge , being viewed as only a statistician . hamilton was excited by fisher 's chapters on eugenics . in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a <other> degree . == hamilton 's rule == hamilton enrolled in an msc course in demography at the london school of economics ( lse ) , under norman carrier , who helped secure various grants for his studies . later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john hajnal of the lse and cedric smith of university college london ( ucl ) . both fisher and j . b. s. haldane had seen a problem in how organisms could increase the fitness of their own genes by aiding their close relatives , but not recognised its significance or properly formulated it . hamilton worked through several examples , and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was sewall wright 's coefficient of relationship . this became hamilton 's rule : in each behaviour-evoking situation , the individual assesses his neighbour 's fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship appropriate to the situation . algebraically , the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if : where c is the cost in fitness to the actor , r the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient , and b is the fitness benefit to the recipient . fitness costs and benefits are measured in fecundity . r is a number between <integer> and <integer> . his two <year> papers entitled the genetical evolution of social behaviour are now widely referenced.the proof and discussion of its consequences , however , involved detailed mathematics , and two reviewers passed over the paper . the third , john maynard smith , did not completely understand it either , but recognised its significance . having his work passed over later led to friction between hamilton and maynard smith , as hamilton thought smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea ( during the review period maynard smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas ) . the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored . recognition of its significance gradually increased to the point that it is now routinely cited in biology books . much of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system . this system means that females are more closely related to their sisters than to their own ( potential ) offspring . thus , hamilton reasoned , a `` costly action '' would be better spent in helping to raise their sisters , rather than reproducing themselves . == spiteful behaviour == in his <year> paper selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model hamilton considers the question of whether harm inflicted upon an organism must inevitably be a byproduct of adaptations for survival . what of possible cases where an organism is deliberately harming others without apparent benefit to the self ? such behaviour hamilton calls spiteful . it can be explained as the increase in the chance of an organism 's genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance . spite , however , is unlikely ever to be elaborated into any complex forms of adaptation . targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge , and the majority of pairs of individuals ( assuming a panmictic species ) exhibit a roughly average level of genetic relatedness , making the selection of targets of spite problematic . == extraordinary sex ratios == between <year> and <year> hamilton was a lecturer at imperial college london . whilst there he published a paper in science on `` extraordinary sex ratios '' . fisher ( <year> ) had proposed a model as to why `` ordinary '' sex ratios were nearly always <other> ( but see edwards <year> ) , and likewise extraordinary sex ratios , particularly in wasps , needed explanations . hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in <year> when he had been assigned to help fisher 's pupil a.w.f . edwards test the fisherian sex ratio hypothesis . hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem , opening up a whole new area of research . the paper was also notable for introducing the concept of the `` unbeatable strategy '' , which john maynard smith and george r. price were to develop into the evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) , a concept in game theory not limited to evolutionary biology . price had originally come to hamilton after deriving the price equation , and thus rederiving hamilton 's rule . maynard smith later peer reviewed one of price 's papers , and drew inspiration from it . the paper was not published but maynard smith offered to make price a co-author of his ess paper , which helped to improve relations between the men . price committed suicide in <year> , and hamilton and maynard smith were among the few present at the funeral.hamilton was regarded as a poor lecturer . this shortcoming would not affect the popularity of his work , however , as it was popularised by richard dawkins in dawkins ' <year> book the selfish gene . in <year> he married christine friess and they were to have three daughters , helen , ruth and rowena . <integer> years later they amicably separated . hamilton was a visiting professor at harvard university and later spent nine months with the royal society 's and the royal geographical society 's xavantina-cachimbo expedition as a visiting professor at the university of são paulo . from <year> hamilton was professor of evolutionary biology at the university of michigan . simultaneously , he was elected a foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences . his arrival sparked protests and sit-ins from students who did not like his association with sociobiology . there he worked with the political scientist robert axelrod on the prisoner 's dilemma , and was a member of the bach group with original members arthur burks , robert axelrod , michael cohen , and john holland . == chasing the red queen == hamilton was an early proponent of the red queen theory of the evolution of sex ( separate from the other theory of the same name previously proposed by leigh van valen ) . this was named for a character in lewis carroll 's through the looking-glass , who is continuously running but never actually travels any distance : `` well , in our country , '' said alice , still panting a little , `` you 'd generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time , as we 've been doing . '' `` a slow sort of country ! '' said the queen . `` now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place . if you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that ! '' ( carroll , pp . <integer> ) this theory hypothesizes that sex evolved because new and unfamiliar combinations of genes could be presented to parasites , preventing the parasite from preying on that organism : species with sex were able to continuously `` run away '' from their parasites . likewise , parasites were able to evolve mechanisms to get around the organism 's new set of genes , thus perpetuating an endless race . == return to britain == in <year> , he was elected a fellow of the royal society , and in <year> , he was invited by richard southwood to be the royal society research professor in the department of zoology at oxford , and a fellow of new college , where he remained until his death . from <year> , hamilton found companionship with maria luisa bozzi , an italian science journalist and author . his collected papers , entitled narrow roads of gene land , began to be published in <year> . the first volume was entitled evolution of social behaviour . == social evolution == the field of social evolution , of which hamilton 's rule has central importance , is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours , i.e . those that impact on the fitness of individuals other than the actor . social behaviours can be categorized according to the fitness consequences they entail for the actor and recipient . a behaviour that increases the direct fitness of the actor is mutually beneficial if the recipient also benefits , and selfish if the recipient suffers a loss . a behaviour that reduces the fitness of the actor is altruistic if the recipient benefits , and spiteful if the recipient suffers a loss . this classification was first proposed by hamilton in 1964.hamilton also proposed the coevolution theory of autumn leaf color as an example of evolutionary signalling theory . == expedition to the congo == during the 1990s , hamilton became increasingly interested in the controversial argument that the origin of hiv lay in oral polio vaccines trials conducted by hilary koprowski in africa during the 1950s . a letter by hamilton on the topic to the major peer-reviewed journal science was rejected in <year> . despite this rejection , he gave supportive declarations on the hypothesis to the bbc and wrote the foreword of a <year> book , the river , by journalist edward hooper , who investigated the hypothesis . to look for indirect evidence of the opv hypothesis by assessing natural levels of simian immunodeficiency virus , in primates , in early <year> , hamilton and two others ventured on a field trip to the then-war-torn democratic republic of the congo . however , none of the over <integer> urine and faecal samples collected by hamilton contained detectable siv virus . == death == he returned to london from africa on <integer> january <year> . he was admitted to university college hospital , london , on <integer> january <year> . he was transferred to middlesex hospital on <integer> february <year> and died there on <integer> march <year> . an inquest was held on <integer> may <year> at westminster coroner 's court to inquire into rumours about the cause of his death . the coroner concluded that his death was due to `` multi-organ failure due to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to a duodenal diverticulum and arterial bleed through a mucosal ulcer '' . following reports attributing his death to complications arising from malaria , the bbc editorial complaints unit 's investigation established that he had contracted malaria during his final african expedition . however , the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the ulceration and consequent haemorrhage had resulted from a pill ( which might have been taken because of malarial symptoms ) lodging in the diverticulum ; but , even if this suggestion were correct , the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect.a secular memorial service ( he was an agnostic ) was held at the chapel of new college , oxford on <integer> july <year> , organised by richard dawkins . he was buried near wytham woods . he , however , had written an essay on my intended burial and why in which he wrote : i will leave a sum in my last will for my body to be carried to brazil and to these forests . it will be laid out in a manner secure against the possums and the vultures just as we make our chickens secure ; and this great coprophanaeus beetle will bury me . they will enter , will bury , will live on my flesh ; and in the shape of their children and mine , i will escape death . no worm for me nor sordid fly , i will buzz in the dusk like a huge bumble bee . i will be many , buzz even as a swarm of motorbikes , be borne , body by flying body out into the brazilian wilderness beneath the stars , lofted under those beautiful and un-fused elytra which we will all hold over our backs . so finally i too will shine like a violet ground beetle under a stone . the second volume of his collected papers , evolution of sex , was published in <year> , and the third and final volume , last words , in <year> . == awards == <year> foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences <year> fellow of the royal society of london <year> newcomb cleveland prize of the american association for the advancement of science <year> darwin medal of the royal society of london <year> scientific medal of the linnean society <year> frink medal of zoological society of london <other> wander prize of the university of bern <year> crafoord prize of the royal swedish academy of sciences <year> kyoto prize of the inamori foundation <year> fyssen prize of the fyssen foundation <year> honorary title of academician of science in finland <year> member of the american philosophical society == biographies == alan grafen has written a biographical memoir for the royal society . a biographical book has also been published by ullica segerstråle : segerstråle , u . <year> . nature 's oracle : the life and work of w. d. hamilton . oxford university press . == works == === collected papers === hamilton started to publish his collected papers starting in <year> , along the lines of fisher 's collected papers , with short essays giving each paper context . he died after the preparation of the second volume , so the essays for the third volume come from his coauthors . hamilton w.d .

secretly moved to paris . traveling to london , she met metro-goldwyn-mayer studio head louis b. mayer , who offered her a movie contract in hollywood . she became a film star with her performance in

( <year> ) , starring walter abel and peter lorre . granowsky soon moved to paris , but lamarr stayed in berlin and was given the lead role in no money needed ( <year> ) , a comedy directed by carl boese . lamarr then starred in the film which made her internationally famous . === ecstasy === in early <year> , at age <integer> , lamarr was given the lead in gustav machatý 's film ecstasy ( ekstase in german , extase in czech ) . she played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man . the film became both celebrated and notorious for showing lamarr 's face in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief nude scenes , a result of her being `` duped '' by the director and producer , who used high-power telephoto lenses.although she was dismayed and now disillusioned about taking other roles , the film gained world recognition after winning an award in rome . throughout europe , it was regarded an artistic work . in america it was considered overly sexual and received negative publicity , especially among women 's groups . it was banned there and in germany . === withdrawal === lamarr played a number of stage roles , including a starring one in sissy , a play about empress elisabeth of austria produced in vienna . it won accolades from critics . admirers sent roses to her dressing room and tried to get backstage to meet her . she sent most of them away , including a man who was more insistent , friedrich mandl . he became obsessed with getting to know her.mandl was an austrian military arms merchant and munitions manufacturer who was reputedly the third-richest man in austria . she fell for his charming and fascinating personality , partly due to his immense financial wealth . her parents , both of jewish descent , did not approve , due to mandl 's ties to italian fascist leader benito mussolini , and later , german führer adolf hitler , but they could not stop the headstrong lamarr.on august <days> , <year> , lamarr married mandl at the karlische . she was <integer> years old and he was <integer> . in her autobiography ecstasy and me , she described mandl as an extremely controlling husband who strongly objected to her simulated orgasm scene in ecstasy and prevented her from pursuing her acting career . she claimed she was kept a virtual prisoner in their castle home , schloss schwarzenau . mandl had close social and business ties to the italian government , selling munitions to the country , and although like hedy , his own father was jewish , had ties to the nazi regime of germany , as well . lamarr wrote that the dictators of both countries attended lavish parties at the mandl home . lamarr accompanied mandl to business meetings , where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology . these conferences were her introduction to the field of applied science and nurtured her latent talent in science.lamarr 's marriage to mandl eventually became unbearable , and she decided to separate herself from both her husband and country in <year> . in her autobiography , she wrote that she disguised herself as her maid and fled to paris , but by other accounts , she persuaded mandl to let her wear all of her jewelry for a dinner party , then disappeared afterward . she writes about her marriage : i knew very soon that i could never be an actress while i was his wife . ... he was the absolute monarch in his marriage . ... i was like a doll . i was like a thing , some object of art which had to be guarded—and imprisoned—having no mind , no life of its own . == hollywood career == === louis b. mayer and mgm === after arriving in london in <year> , she met louis b. mayer , head of mgm , who was scouting for talent in europe . she initially turned down the offer he made her ( of $ <integer> a week ) , but then booked herself onto the same new york bound liner as him , and managed to impress him enough to secure a $ <integer> a week contract . mayer persuaded her to change her name to hedy lamarr ( to distance herself from her real identity , and `` the ecstasy lady '' reputation associated with it ) , choosing the surname in homage to the beautiful silent film star , barbara la marr , on the suggestion of his wife , who admired la marr . he brought her to hollywood in <year> and began promoting her as the `` world 's most beautiful woman '' .mayer loaned lamarr to producer walter wanger , who was making algiers ( <year> ) , an american version of the french film , pépé le moko ( <year> ) . lamarr was cast in the lead opposite charles boyer . the film created a `` national sensation '' , says shearer . : <integer> she was billed as an unknown but well-publicized austrian actress , which created anticipation in audiences . mayer hoped she would become another greta garbo or marlene dietrich . : <integer> according to one viewer , when her face first appeared on the screen , `` everyone gasped ... lamarr 's beauty literally took one 's breath away . `` : <integer> in future hollywood films , she was invariably typecast as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origin . her second american film was to be i take this woman , co-starring with spencer tracy under the direction of regular dietrich collaborator , josef von sternberg . von sternberg was fired during the shoot , replaced by frank borzage . the film was put on hold , and lamarr was put into lady of the tropics ( <year> ) , where she played a mixed-race seductress in saigon opposite robert taylor . she returned to i take this woman , re-shot by w. s. van dyke . the resulting film was a flop . far more popular was boom town ( <year> ) with clark gable , claudette colbert and spencer tracy ; it made $ <integer> million . mgm promptly reteamed lamarr and gable in comrade x ( <year> ) , a comedy film in the vein of ninotchka ( <year> ) , which was another hit . lamarr was teamed with james stewart in come live with me ( <year> ) , playing a viennese refugee . stewart was also in ziegfeld girl ( <year> ) , where lamarr , judy garland and lana turner played aspiring showgirls - a big success.lamarr was top-billed in h. m. pulham , esq . ( <year> ) , although the film 's protagonist was the title role played by robert young . she made a third film with tracy , tortilla flat ( <year> ) . it was successful at the box office , as was crossroads ( <year> ) with william powell . lamarr played the seductive native girl tondelayo in white cargo ( <year> ) , top billed over walter pidgeon . it was a huge hit . white cargo contains arguably her most memorable film quote , delivered with provocative invitation : `` i am tondelayo . i make tiffin for you ? '' this line typifies many of lamarr 's roles , which emphasized her beauty and sensuality while giving her relatively few lines . the lack of acting challenges bored lamarr . she reportedly took up inventing to relieve her boredom.she was reunited with powell in a comedy the heavenly body ( <year> ) , then was borrowed by warner bros for the conspirators ( <year> ) . this was an attempt to repeat the success of casablanca ( <year> ) , and rko borrowed her for a melodrama experiment perilous ( <year> ) . back at mgm lamarr was teamed with robert walker in the romantic comedy her highness and the bellboy ( <year> ) , playing a princess who falls in love with a new yorker . it was very popular , but would be the last film she made under her mgm contract.her off-screen life and personality during those years was quite different from her screen image . she spent much of her time feeling lonely and homesick . she might swim at her agent 's pool , but shunned the beaches and staring crowds . when asked for an autograph , she wondered why anyone would want it . writer howard sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression : hedy has the most incredible personal sophistication . she knows the peculiarly european art of being womanly ; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman , what attracts them , and she forces herself to be these things . she has magnetism with warmth , something that neither dietrich nor garbo has managed to achieve . author richard rhodes describes her assimilation into american culture : of all the european émigrés who escaped nazi germany and nazi austria , she was one of the very few who succeeded in moving to another culture and becoming a full-fledged star herself . there were so very few who could make the transition linguistically or culturally . she really was a resourceful human being–i think because of her father 's strong influence on her as a child . lamarr also had a penchant for speaking about herself in the third person . === wartime fundraiser === lamarr wanted to join the national inventors council , but was reportedly told by nic member charles f. kettering and others that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell war bonds.she participated in a war bond-selling campaign with a sailor named eddie rhodes . rhodes was in the crowd at each lamarr appearance , and she would call him up on stage . she would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss . the crowd would say yes , to which hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds . after enough bonds were purchased , she would kiss rhodes and he would head back into the audience . then they would head off to the next war bond rally . === producer === after leaving mgm in <year> , lamarr formed a production company with jack chertok and made the thriller the strange woman ( <year> ) . it went over budget and only made minor profits.she and chertok then made dishonored lady ( <year> ) , another thriller starring lamarr , which also went over budget - but was not a commercial success . she tried a comedy with robert cummings , let 's live a little ( <year> ) . === later films === lamarr enjoyed her biggest success playing delilah against victor mature as the biblical strongman in cecil b. demille 's samson and delilah , the highest-grossing film of <year> . the film also won two oscars.lamarr returned to mgm for a film noir with john hodiak , a lady without passport ( <year> ) , which flopped . more popular were two pictures she made at paramount , a western with ray milland , copper canyon ( <year> ) , and a bob hope spy spoof , my favorite spy ( <year> ) . her career went into decline . she went to italy to play multiple roles in loves of three queens ( <year> ) , which she also produced . however she lacked the experience necessary to make a success of such an epic production , and lost millions of dollars when she was unable to secure distribution of the picture . she was joan of arc in irwin allen 's critically panned epic , the story of mankind ( <year> ) and did episodes of zane grey theatre ( `` proud woman '' ) and shower of stars ( `` cloak and dagger '' ) . her last film was a thriller the female animal ( <year> ) . lamarr was signed to act in the <year> film picture mommy dead , but was let go when she collapsed during filming from nervous exhaustion . she was replaced in the role of jessica flagmore shelley by zsa zsa gabor . == inventor == although lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught , she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions , which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink . the beverage was unsuccessful ; lamarr herself said it tasted like alka-seltzer . among the few who knew of lamarr 's inventiveness was aviation tycoon howard hughes . she suggested he change the rather square design of his aeroplanes ( which she thought looked too slow ) to a more streamlined shape , based on pictures of the fastest birds and fish she could find . lamarr discussed her relationship with hughes during an interview , saying that while they dated , he actively supported her `` tinkering '' hobbies . he put his team of scientists and engineers at her disposal , saying they would do or make anything she asked for.during world war ii , lamarr learned that radio-controlled torpedoes , an emerging technology in naval war , could easily be jammed and set off course . she thought of creating a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed . she contacted her friend , composer and pianist george antheil , to help her develop a device for doing that , and he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player-piano mechanism with radio signals . they drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system , which they patented . antheil recalled : we began talking about the war , which , in the late summer of <year> , was looking most extremely black . hedy said that she did not feel very comfortable , sitting there in hollywood and making lots of money when things were in such a state . she said that she knew a good deal about munitions and various secret weapons ... and that she was thinking seriously of quitting mgm and going to washington , dc , to offer her services to the newly established inventors ' council . their invention was granted a patent under us patent 2,292,387 on august <days> , <year> ( filed using her married name hedy kiesler markey ) . however , it was technologically difficult to implement , and at that time the u.s. navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from outside the military . in <year> ( at the time of the cuban missile crisis ) , an updated version of their design at last appeared on navy ships.in <year> , lamarr and antheil received the electronic frontier foundation pioneer award and the bulbie gnass spirit of achievement bronze award , given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts , sciences , business , or invention fields have significantly contributed to society . lamarr was featured on the science channel and the discovery channel . in <year> , lamarr and antheil were posthumously inducted into the national inventors hall of fame . == later years == lamarr became a naturalized citizen of the united states at age <integer> on april <days> , <year> . her autobiography , ecstasy and me , was published in <year> , although she said on tv that it was not written by her , and much of it was fictional . lamarr later sued the publisher , saying that many details were fabricated by its ghost writer , leo guild . lamarr , in turn , was sued by gene ringgold , who asserted that the book plagiarized material from an article he had written in <year> for screen facts magazine.in the late 1950s lamarr designed and , with then-husband w. howard lee , developed the villa lamarr ski resort in aspen , colorado.in <year> , lamarr was arrested in los angeles for shoplifting . the charges were eventually dropped . in <year> , she was arrested on the same charge in florida , this time for stealing $ 21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops . she pleaded no contest to avoid a court appearance , and the charges were dropped in return for her promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year . the shoplifting charges coincided with a failed attempt to return to the screen . the 1970s were a decade of increasing seclusion for lamarr . she was offered several scripts , television commercials , and stage projects , but none piqued her interest . in <year> , she filed a $ <integer> million lawsuit against warner bros. , claiming that the running parody of her name ( `` hedley lamarr '' ) in the mel brooks comedy blazing saddles infringed her right to privacy . brooks said he was flattered ; the studio settled out of court for an undisclosed nominal sum and an apology to lamarr for `` almost using her name '' . brooks said that lamarr `` never got the joke '' . with her eyesight failing , lamarr retreated from public life and settled in miami beach , florida , in 1981.a large corel-drawn image of lamarr won coreldraw 's yearly software suite cover design contest in <year> . for several years , beginning in <year> , it was featured on boxes of the software suite . lamarr sued the company for using her image without her permission . corel countered that she did not own rights to the image . the parties reached an undisclosed settlement in 1998.for her contribution to the motion picture industry , lamarr has a star on the hollywood walk of fame at <year> hollywood blvd adjacent to vine street where the walk is centered . lamarr became estranged from her older son , james lamarr loder , when he was <integer> years old . their relationship ended abruptly , and he moved in with another family . they did not speak again for almost <integer> years . lamarr left james loder out of her will , and he sued for control of the us $ 3.3 million estate left by lamarr in <year> . he eventually settled for us $ 50,000 . === seclusion === in the last decades of her life , the telephone became lamarr 's only means of communication with the outside world , even with her children and close friends . she often talked up to six or seven hours a day on the phone , but she spent hardly any time with anyone in person in her final years . a documentary , calling hedy lamarr , was released in <year> and featured her children , anthony loder and denise loder-deluca . === death === lamarr died in casselberry , florida , on january <days> , <year> , of heart disease , aged <integer> . her son anthony loder spread her ashes in austria 's vienna woods in accordance with her last wishes.in <year> a memorial to lamarr was unveiled in vienna 's central cemetery . == awards == hedy lamarr was honored with a star on the hollywood walk of fame in 1960.in <year> , lamarr was selected the `` most promising new actress '' of <year> in a poll of area voters conducted by philadelphia record film critic . british moviegoers voted hedy lamarr the year 's 10th best actress , for her performance in samson and delilah in 1951.in <year> , lamarr and george antheil were jointly honored with the electronic frontier foundation 's pioneer award and lamarr also was the first woman to receive the invention convention 's bulbie gnass spirit of achievement award , known as the `` oscars of inventing '' . the following year , lamarr 's native austria awarded her the viktor kaplan medal of the austrian association of patent holders and inventors.in <year> , the hedy-lamarr-weg was founded in vienna meidling ( 12th district ) , named after the actress . in <year> , the iqoqi installed a quantum telescope on the roof of the university of vienna , which they name after her in 2014.in <year> , lamarr was posthumously inducted into the national inventors hall of fame for frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology . the same year , anthony loder 's request that the remaining ashes of his mother should be buried in an honorary grave of the city of vienna was realized . on november <days> , her urn was buried at the vienna central cemetery in group <integer> g , tomb no . <integer> , not far from the centrally located presidential tomb.on november <days> , <year> , google honored her on her 101st birthday with a doodle.on august <days> , <year> , an asteroid was named after her : <integer> lamarr == marriages and children == lamarr was married and divorced six times and had three children : friedrich mandl ( married 1933–1937 ) , chairman of the hirtenberger patronen-fabrik gene markey ( married 1939–1941 ) , screenwriter and producer . she adopted a child , james lamarr markey ( born january <days> , <year> ) during her marriage with markey .

<integer> september <year> – <integer> march <year> ) was a soviet official who became a russian banker following the dissolution of the soviet union . born in the city of moscow , then part of the russian soviet federative socialist republic , pavlov began his political career in the ministry of finance in <year> . later , during the brezhnev era , he became head of the financial department of the state planning committee . pavlov was appointed to the post of chairman of the state committee on prices during the gorbachev era , and later became minister of finance in nikolai ryzhkov 's second government . he went on to succeed ryzhkov as head of government in the newly established post of prime minister of the soviet union . as prime minister pavlov initiated the <year> soviet monetary reform , commonly referred to as the pavlov reform , in early <year> . early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of soviet roubles transported to the soviet union from abroad . although ridiculed at the time , the statement was later proven to be true . <days> june the same year , pavlov called for a transfer of power from the president of the soviet union to the prime minister and the cabinet of ministers . when that failed , he joined a plot to oust gorbachev . in august <days> he participated in the <year> soviet coup d'état attempt , which tried to prevent the disintegration of the soviet union . pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-soviet russia . he is seen by some as the last legitimate soviet head of government since his successor , ivan silayev , was appointed by the russian soviet federative socialist republic in breach of what his opponents consider to be soviet constitutional principles . == early life and career == born in moscow on <integer> september <year> , pavlov graduated from the moscow finance institute in <year> . he started his nomenklatura ( bureaucratic ) career as a government economist ; he started working for as an official of the ministry of finance in <year> , and became a member of the communist party of the soviet union in <year> . early in his career he also worked for the ministry of finance of the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( rsfsr ) . pavlov started working for the state planning committee in <year> , and became a member of the state planning committee 's board in <year> . he held the office as head of the state planning committee 's finance department , the department which oversaw all aspects of the country 's planned economy . he served as first deputy minister of finance in boris gostev 's ministry from january <days> august 1986.pavlov was appointed chairman of the state committee on prices on <integer> august <year> , and retained that post until <integer> june <year> . throughout the period , and later as minister of finance , pavlov supported the centralised price reform proposal posited by nikolai ryzhkov , chairman of the council of ministers . he succeeded gostev to become minister of finance in ryzhkov 's government in <year> and his time in the post was considered uncontroversial , even though lira rozenova , deputy chairman of the state committee for prices , was not elected to the post of chairman of the state committee for her advocacy of pavlov-backed plans for centrally administered price reform . he was the only minister in ryzhkov 's government who was also a member of the presidium of the council of ministers.along with eduard shevardnadze – soviet foreign minister – pavlov was the only nominee from ryzhkov 's second government to be overwhelmingly elected by the supreme soviet of the soviet union . as minister of finance , pavlov was supportive of the marketisation of the soviet economy , having overseen a rapid increase in the soviet money supply and the increase in inflation it caused . pavlov also set the exchange rate for the rouble against the american dollar on the soviet black market . in <year> he proudly admitted that during his tenure as minister of finance , and later prime minister , he had deceived several western banks and creditors by lying about the soviet union 's gold reserves . in <year> , pavlov gathered together enough information on the errors and omissions of ivan silayev , the future soviet premier and russian sfsr premier , to weaken his position as deputy premier . silayev never forgave pavlov and relations between the two grew even more icy when pavlov became soviet premier . == prime minister == following the resignation of nikolai ryzhkov following a heart attack <days> december <year> , pavlov was elected to the new position of prime minister as a compromise candidate , and became chairman of the cabinet of ministers . he and his two first deputy prime ministers , vladimir velichko and vitaly doguzhiev , were approved and elected by the supreme soviet of the soviet union on <integer> january <days> with <integer> votes in favour , <integer> against , and <integer> abstained , while approval for the majority of his ministers followed within a few weeks . pavlov was considered a conservative upon his election as prime minister , and the soviet press described him as a `` bold and complex man '' who was against full marketisation but who believed that the soviet union was even more oppressive towards workers than even the most advanced capitalist societies . one of his first actions as prime minister was to move the headquarters of the soviet government – the cabinet of ministers – from the moscow kremlin to the former headquarters of the state committee for construction to strengthen his position . === <year> monetary reform === the soviet monetary reform of <year> , commonly referred to as the pavlov reform , was the last monetary reform prior to the dissolution of the soviet union , despite having made a speech <integer> weeks before , saying there would be no such reforms . initiated on <integer> january <year> , it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods , which were in short supply . in a speech , pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government 's belief that money was being sent to the soviet union from abroad , fuelling inflation . although ridiculed by the soviet press at the time , three years later the truth of pavlov 's statement was verified . mikhail gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in <year> . the directive also included <other> and <other> banknotes issued in <year> . on <integer> january <year> , the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to <integer> rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials , capitalists and criminals.under the orders of pavlov , the government freed forty percent of prices on <integer> january <year> , and introduced sales tax of <integer> % . prices of consumer goods , in particular , were now considered free in the sense that negotiation became possible between producers and the distributor . according to philip hanson in his book , the rise and fall of the soviet economy : an economic history of the ussr from <year> , pavlov 's reform was undermined by the union republics who failed to follow pavlov 's orders , along with the widespread existence of local monopolies , which tended to have their own definition of luxury goods and as a result imposed higher prices on such items.soviet citizens had only three days from <integer> to <integer> january <days> exchange their old <integer> rouble and <integer> rouble banknotes for the new currency . exchange could be postponed , but only through specialized government commissions . due to this short exchange window , long queues formed in front of soviet savings banks , even though it was also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices . this reform also dealt a crippling blow to soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged ; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.in the end the reform proved unsuccessful . the government only managed to withdraw <integer> billion rubles from circulation of the country 's money supply against an intended target of 81.5 billion rubles . as a result , the pavlov reform did not put an end to inflation . prices for items including food and transport rose by 100–300 percent , while the soviet standard of living decreased sharply and the state budget deficit increased by an estimated 20–30 percent of gnp . in the aftermath of the reform , inflation exceeded the <integer> percent mark every month . === coup attempt === <days> june <year> , pavlov , who felt that the office of prime minister had limited power , discovered that gorbachev planned to replace him as prime minister . in response , he arrived at the supreme soviet of the soviet union `` visibly nervous '' , and in his report to the supreme soviet , he was forced to tell delegates of the faltering state of the soviet economy . however , pavlov blamed this on the ongoing war of laws between the supreme soviet of the soviet union and the supreme soviet of the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( rsfsr ) , which , he argued , could be resolved by introducing a state of emergency across the entire soviet union , or at least in certain economic sectors.according to pavlov , the union 's problems remained insoluble as long as gorbachev retained so much power and had limited time to address important issues . to break the impasse , pavlov called for a transfer of power from the president of the soviet union to the prime minister and the cabinet of ministers , ( specifically , he wanted the cabinet to have the right to issue decrees on economic affairs without the approval of the president ) , even creating a five-point resolution to that end for the legislature to consider . pavlov received support for the idea from the soyuz parliamentary faction leader viktor alksnis , who called for an immediate vote on the issue . however , several members of soyuz also demanded a statement by the kgb and the ministry of defence to comment on the proposal . in retrospect , alksnis notes that this resolution could have become a coup d'état had pavlov consulted with them earlier . according to historian jerry f. hough , pavlov 's program `` was not directed as much at gorbachev as at [ boris ] yeltsin '' .by the afternoon , the majority of soyuz members favoured an immediate vote . the chairman of the supreme soviet of the soviet union , anatoly lukyanov , had already departed for novo ogarevo to take part in constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell gorbachev about the vote . in his place stood ivan laptev , a pro-gorbachev reformer , who did not trust lukyanov and tried to stall the vote by demanding a statement from the kgb , ministry of the interior and the ministry of defence . according to laptev , the mood was such that if a vote had been taken pavlov would have won . at the time , both the soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the soviet government and so they too supported pavlov 's program . soyuz , through a vote , was able to increase the powers of the cabinet of ministers , and gave the institution the right of legislative initiative.shortly afterwards , jack matlock , united states ambassador to the soviet union , told gorbachev of the possibility of a coup attempt against him , and the soviet leader became worried when anatoly chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside moscow . on <integer> june <days> four days after pavlov 's speech , gorbachev addressed the supreme soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and pavlov . even when he had been able to secure his position , gorbachev 's power within the system was already faltering , although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the cabinet of ministers reversed . the power struggle between gorbachev and pavlov was not over , with gorbachev , on july <days> , <year> , promising yeltsin and nursultan nazarbayev that pavlov , along with dmitry yazov , minister of defence , and vladimir kryuchkov , the chairman of the kgb , would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the new union treaty , with nazarbayev to be appointed in pavlov 's place as prime minister . === august coup === the <year> soviet coup d'état attempt , commonly referred to as the august coup , was prompted by the slow disintegration of the soviet union that resulted from gorbachev 's reform policy and yeltsin 's drive towards an independent russia . the new union treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics , which weakened the government 's already tenuous hold on the economy . pavlov received a draft of the new union treaty on <integer> august <days> a security council meeting and managed to get it published in the moscow news on <integer> august.opposing the decentralisation stance taken in the treaty , pavlov was one of the key players in the establishment of the state committee for the state of emergency <days> august <year> . pavlov 's inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness to revert to pre-gorbachev policies . the committee 's main goal was to ensure that the soviet union continued as a highly centralised union state . the emergency committee was led by gennady yanayev , vice president of the soviet union , interior minister boris pugo , defence minister dmitry yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust gorbachev.vladimir kryuchkov , the kgb chairman , had told pavlov of the coup on <integer> august <days> one day before it began . he was asked by kryuchkov to meet his co-plotters at the moscow kremlin , where on <integer> august <days> he and his co-conspirators appeared on live television and told the soviet people that gorbachev was indisposed . as the day wore on it soon became apparent that pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself . in retrospect he admitted that he had been drinking with his son the day before . on the same day , his fellow plotters decided to depose pavlov , sending him to his dacha where his wife took care of him . as with all the others , pavlov was arrested following the collapse of the coup . shortly after pavlov was hospitalised with hypertension whilst remaining in custody . he was released on recognizance not to leave <days> january <year> and granted amnesty by the russian state duma in <year>
