eric william kierans ( february <days> , <year> – may <days> , <year> ) was a canadian economist and politician . == early life == born in montreal , kierans grew up in the working-class saint-henri neighbourhood . his father worked at canadian car and foundry , and his mother came to canada as a domestic . from <year> to <year> , he attended loyola college . == career == after serving as director of the school of commerce at mcgill university and president of the montreal stock exchange , kierans entered provincial politics in <year> . nicknamed the `` socialist millionaire , '' he was appointed minister of revenue and then minister of health in the quebec liberal government of quebec premier jean lesage during the quiet revolution . kierans became president of the quebec liberal party and clashed with former cabinet minister and colleague rené lévesque in <year> , daring him to give up the idea of quebec separatism or quit the liberal party . lévesque later quit the liberal party and established the mouvement souveraineté-association , which became quebec 's leading sovereigntist party as the parti québécois . initially a critic of walter l. gordon 's economic nationalism , kierans ' experience in government changed his mind , and he became a believer in the need for state intervention in the economy . in <year> , kierans entered federal politics running unsuccessfully for the leadership of the liberal party of canada at its <year> leadership convention . he was elected to the house of commons in the <year> federal election . kierans served as postmaster-general and minister of communications in the cabinet of prime minister pierre trudeau . he did not run for re-election in the <year> election , partly as a result of his criticisms of trudeau 's economic policy . kierans called for canada to leave the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) in <year> . he argued that the organization might have served a useful purpose on its initial formation but had since become anachronistic . some others with the trudeau government agreed with kierans , but others strongly disagreed . the trudeau government ultimately kept canada in nato but reduced canada 's troop deployment . he considered running for the leadership of the new democratic party in <year> but declined in favour of ed broadbent . after leaving politics , kierans taught at mcgill and dalhousie university . in the 1980s , he became a familiar voice appearing with dalton camp and stephen lewis as part of a weekly political panel on peter gzowski 's canadian broadcasting corporation radio show , morningside . in <year> , he was made an officer of the order of canada . == archives == there is an eric william kierans fonds at library and archives canada .

<days> , <year> – october <days> , <year> ) was the gene and norman hackerman professor of chemistry and a professor of physics and astronomy at rice university . in <year> , along with robert curl , also a professor of chemistry at rice , and harold kroto , a professor at the university of sussex , he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery of a new form of carbon , buckminsterfullerene , also known as buckyballs . he was an advocate of nanotechnology and its applications . == early life and education == smalley , the youngest of <integer> siblings , was born in akron , ohio on june <days> , <year> to frank dudley smalley , jr. , and esther virginia rhoads . he grew up in kansas city , missouri . richard smalley credits his father , mother and aunt as formative influences in industry , science and chemistry . his father , frank dudley smalley , jr. worked with mechanical and electrical equipment and eventually became ceo of a trade journal for farm implements called implement and tractor . his mother , esther rhoads smalley , completed her b.a . degree while richard was a teenager . she was particularly inspired by mathematician norman n. royall jr. , who taught foundations of physical science , and communicated her love of science to her son through long conversations and joint activities . smalley 's maternal aunt , pioneering female chemist sara jane rhoads , interested smalley in the field of chemistry , letting him work in her organic chemistry laboratory , and suggesting that he attend hope college , which had a strong chemistry program.smalley attended hope college for two years before transferring to the university of michigan where he received his bachelor of science in <year> , performing undergraduate research in the laboratory of raoul kopelman . between his studies , he also worked in industry , where he developed his unique managerial style . he received his ph.d. from princeton university in <year> after completing a doctoral dissertation , titled `` the lower electronic states of 1,3,5 ( sym ) -triazine '' , under the supervision of elliot r. bernstein . he did postdoctoral work at the university of chicago from <year> to <year> , with donald levy and lennard wharton where he was a pioneer in the development of supersonic beam laser spectroscopy . == career == in <year> , smalley joined rice university . in <year> , he was appointed to the gene and norman hackerman chair in chemistry at rice . he helped to found the rice quantum institute in <year> , serving as chairman from <year> to <year> . in <year> , he became also a professor in the department of physics . in <year> , he helped to found the center for nanoscale science and technology . in <year> , he was appointed its director.he became a member of the national academy of sciences in <year> , and the american academy of arts and sciences in <year> . === fullerenes === smalley 's research in physical chemistry investigated the formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time-of-flight mass spectrometry . as a consequence of this expertise , robert curl introduced him to harry kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust . these are carbon-rich grains expelled by old stars such as r coronae borealis . the result of this collaboration was the discovery of c60 ( known as buckyballs ) and the fullerenes as the third allotropic form of carbon.the research that earned kroto , smalley and curl the nobel prize mostly comprised three articles . first was the discovery of c60 in the nov. <integer> , <year> , issue of nature , `` c60 : buckminsterfullerene '' . the second article detailed the discovery of the endohedral fullerenes in `` lanthanum complexes of spheroidal carbon shells '' in the journal of the american chemical society ( <year> ) . the third announced the discovery of the fullerenes in `` reactivity of large carbon clusters : spheroidal carbon shells and their possible relevance to the formation and morphology of soot '' in the journal of physical chemistry ( <year> ) .although only three people can be cited for a nobel prize , graduate students james r. heath , yuan liu , and sean c. o'brien participated in the work . smalley mentioned heath and o'brien in his nobel lecture . heath went on to become a professor at the california institute of technology ( caltech ) and o'brien joined texas instruments and is now at memtronics . yuan liu is a senior staff scientist at oak ridge national laboratory.this research is significant for the discovery of a new allotrope of carbon known as a fullerene . other allotropes of carbon include graphite , diamond and graphene . harry kroto 's <year> paper entitled `` c60 : buckminsterfullerine '' , published with colleagues j. r. heath , s. c. o'brien , r. f. curl , and r. e. smalley , was honored by a citation for chemical breakthrough award from the division of history of chemistry of the american chemical society , presented to rice university in <year> . the discovery of fullerenes was recognized in <year> by the designation of a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society at the richard e. smalley institute for nanoscale science and technology at rice university in houston , texas . === nanotechnology === following nearly a decade 's worth of research into the formation of alternate fullerene compounds ( e.g . c28 , c70 ) , as well as the synthesis of endohedral metallofullerenes ( m @ c60 ) , reports of the identification of carbon nanotube structures led smalley to begin investigating their iron-catalyzed synthesis.as a consequence of this research , smalley was able to persuade the administration of rice university , under then-president malcolm gillis , to create rice 's center for nanoscale science and technology ( cnst ) focusing on any aspect of molecular nanotechnology . it was renamed the richard e. smalley institute for nanoscale science and technology after smalley 's death in <year> , and has since merged with the rice quantum institute , becoming the smalley-curl institute ( sci ) in 2015.smalley 's latest research was focused on carbon nanotubes , specifically focusing on the chemical synthesis side of nanotube research . he is well known for his group 's invention of the high-pressure carbon monoxide ( hipco ) method of producing large batches of high-quality nanotubes . smalley spun off his work into a company , carbon nanotechnologies inc. and associated nanotechnologies . === dispute on molecular assemblers === he was an outspoken skeptic of the idea of molecular assemblers , as advocated by k. eric drexler . his main scientific objections , which he termed the `` fat fingers problem '' and the `` sticky fingers problem '' , argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms . he also believed that drexler 's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threatened the public support for development of nanotechnology . he debated drexler in an exchange of letters which were published in chemical & engineering news as a point-counterpoint feature . == advocacy == starting in the late 1990s , smalley advocated for the need for cheap , clean energy , which he described as the number one problem facing humanity in the 21st century . he described what he called `` the terawatt challenge '' , the need to develop a new power source capable of increasing `` our energy output by a minimum factor of two , the generally agreed-upon number , certainly by the middle of the century , but preferably well before that . `` he also presented a list entitled `` top ten problems of humanity for next <integer> years '' . it can be interesting to compare his list , in order of priority , to the ten threats formulated by the u.n. 's high level threat panel in <year> . smalley 's list , in order of priority , was : energy water food environment poverty terrorism & war disease education democracy populationsmalley regarded several problems as interlinked : the lack of people entering the fields of science and engineering , the need for an alternative to fossil fuels , and the need to address global warming . he felt that improved science education was essential , and strove to encourage young students to consider careers in science . his slogan for this effort was `` be a scientist , save the world . `` smalley was a leading advocate of the national nanotechnology initiative in <year> . suffering from hair loss and weakness as a result of his chemotherapy treatments , smalley testified before the congressional testimonies , arguing for the potential benefits of nanotechnology in the development of targeted cancer therapies . bill <integer> , the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act , was introduced in the senate on january <days> , <year> by senator ron wyden , passed the senate on november <days> , <year> , and at the house of representatives the next day with a 405–19 vote . president george w. bush signed the act into law on december <days> , <year> , as public law <other> <integer> . smalley was invited to attend . == personal life == smalley was married four times , to judith grace sampieri ( <other> ) , mary l. chapieski ( <other> ) , jonell m. chauvin ( <other> ) and deborah sheffield ( <year> ) , and had two sons , chad richard smalley ( born june <days> , <year> ) and preston reed smalley ( born august <days> , <year> ) .in <year> , smalley was diagnosed with cancer . smalley died of leukemia , variously reported as non-hodgkin 's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia , on october <days> , <year> , at m.d . anderson cancer center in houston , texas , at the age of 62.upon smalley 's death , the us senate passed a resolution to honor smalley , crediting him as the `` father of nanotechnology . '' === religion during final years === smalley , who had taken classes in religion as well as science at hope college , rediscovered his religious foundation in later life , particularly during his final years while battling cancer . during the final year of his life , smalley wrote : `` although i suspect i will never fully understand , i now think the answer is very simple : it 's true . god did create the universe about 13.7 billion years ago , and of necessity has involved himself with his creation ever since . `` at the tuskegee university 's 79th annual scholarship convocation/parents ' recognition program he was quoted making the following statement regarding the subject of evolution while urging his audience to take seriously their role as the higher species on this planet . `` 'genesis ' was right , and there was a creation , and that creator is still involved ... we are the only species that can destroy the earth or take care of it and nurture all that live on this very special planet . i 'm urging you to look on these things . for whatever reason , this planet was built specifically for us . working on this planet is an absolute moral code . ... let 's go out and do what we were put on earth to do .

( the action française royalist movement belongs to the legitimists , who , being marginalized during the 20th century , managed however to take back some influence during the vichy régime . ) similarly , he classes the national front ( le pen 's party ) in this group . orléanists he identifies as economic liberals , which characterizes present-day conservative parties . this group presents itself as bourgeois rather than populist . rémond died <days> april <year> in paris at the age of <integer> . == bibliography == lamennais et la démocratie ( <year> ) la droite en france de <year> à nos jours ( <year> ) histoire des états-unis ( <year> ) les catholiques , le communisme et les crises ( 1929–1939 ) ( <year> ) les états-unis devant l ’ opinion française ( 1815–1852 ) , <integer> volumes ( <year> ) les deux congrès ecclésiastiques de reims et bourges ( 1896–1900 ) ( <year> ) la vie politique en france , tome <integer> : <other> ( <year> ) forces religieuses et attitudes politiques dans la france depuis <year> ( contributing editor ; <year> ) atlas historique de la france contemporaine ( contributing editor ; <year> ) léon blum , chef de gouvernement ( contributing editor ; <year> ) la droite en france , de la première restauration à la ve république , <integer> volumes ( <year> ) la vie politique en france , tome <integer> : <other> ( <year> ) le gouvernement de vichy et la révolution nationale ( contributing editor ; <year> ) introduction à l ’ histoire de notre temps , <integer> volumes ( <year> ) l ’ anticléricalisme en france de <year> à nos jours ( <year> ) vivre notre histoire ( entretien avec aimé savard ) ( <year> ) édouard daladier , chef de gouvernement ( <year> ) la france et les français en <other> ( <year> ) la règle et le consentement . gouverner une société ( <year> ) les droites en france ( <year> , published in <year> ) quarante ans de cabinets ministériels ( contributing editor , <year> ) le retour de de gaulle ( <year> ) essais d ’ ego-histoire ( in collaboration ; <year> ) pour une histoire politique ( contributing editor ; <year> ) notre siècle ( 1918–1988 ) , rééditions mises à jour , <year> et <year> ( <year> ) age et politique ( in collaboration ; <year> ) paul touvier et l ’ église ( in collaboration ; <year> ) valeurs et politique ( <year> ) histoire de la france religieuse ( co-contributing editor ; <year> ) la politique n ’ est plus ce qu ’ elle était ( <year> ) le catholicisme français et la société politique ( <year> ) le fichier juif ( in collaboration ; <year> ) les crises du catholicisme en france dans les années trente ( <year> ) religion et société en europe aux xixe et xxe siècles . essai sur la sécularisation ( <year> ) une laïcité pour tous ( <year> ) l'anticléricalisme en france ( <year> ) les grandes inventions du christianisme ( <year> ) la politique est-elle intelligible ?

== references == == external links == история одной фотографии . в объятиях вождя дети-герои . эстафета пионерского подвига augusto boal ( <integer> march <year> – <integer> may <year> ) was a brazilian theatre practitioner , drama theorist , and political activist . he was the founder of theatre of the oppressed , a theatrical form originally used in radical left popular education movements . boal served one term as a vereador ( the brazilian equivalent of a city councillor ) in rio de janeiro from <year> to <year> , where he developed legislative theatre . == biography == === early life === augusto boal studied at columbia university in new york with the critic john gassner . gassner introduced boal to the techniques of both bertolt brecht and konstantin stanislavski , and encouraged boal to form links with theatre groups like the black experimental theatre . in <year> boal staged productions of two of his own plays , the horse and the saint and the house across the street . in <year> , shortly after graduating , boal was asked to work with the arena theatre in são paulo , southeast brazil . boal was in charge of directing plays along with other dramaturgs such as josé renato , who was also the founder of the arena theatre . it was here that he began to experiment with new forms of theatre never before seen in brazil , such as stanislavski 's 'system ' for actors , with which he became familiar during his time at columbia and when involved with the actors studio in new york . boal adapted these methods to social conditions in brazil , taking a leftist approach on issues concerning nationalism , which were very much in vogue at that time period since the country had just undergone a long period of military dictatorship . === work at the arena theatre of são paulo === while working at the arena theatre in são paulo , boal directed a number of classical dramas , which he transformed to make them more pertinent to brazilian society and its economy . among these plays was john steinbeck 's of mice and men , known in brazil as ratos e homens . this was boal 's first performance as a director at the arena theatre of são paulo . critics acclaimed this piece and boal won the prêmio de revelação de direção ( direction revelation award ) from the association of art critics of são paulo , in <year> . in the early sixties , the ratings at the arena theatre of são paulo started to drop , almost causing the theatre to go bankrupt . consequently , the company decided to start investing in national theatre ( pieces written by brazilian dramaturgs ) as a move that could possibly save it from bankruptcy . the new investment proved to be a success , opening up the path for a national theatre scene . boal then suggested the creation of a seminar in dramaturgy at the arena theatre , which was quickly implemented and soon became a national platform for many young playwrights . many successful productions were born from this seminar and now form part of the arena theatre of são paulo 's nationalist phase repertoire . one of these productions was chapetuba futebol clube , written by oduvaldo vianna filho in <year> and directed by augusto boal . === exile === a new military regime started in brazil in <year> with a coup d'état supported by the brazilian elite , the industrialists , the military , as well as by the united states , boal 's teachings were controversial , and as a cultural activist he was seen as a threat by the brazilian military regime . in <year> , boal was kidnapped off the street , arrested , tortured , and eventually exiled to argentina , where he stayed for five years . during those five years , boal published two books : torquemada ( <year> ) and his much acclaimed theatre of the oppressed ( <year> ) . torquemada is about the brazilian military regime 's systematic use of torture in prison . boal takes the name of the leading figure of the spanish inquisition , tomas de torquemada , as an example of historical forms of systematic torture . in theatre of the oppressed boal develops a theatrical method based on pedagogy of the oppressed , a book by the brazilian educator and writer paulo freire ( who was also a good friend of boal ) .boal 's method ( which has been implemented in various communities around the world ) seeks to transform audiences into active participants in the theatrical experience . boal argues that traditional theatre is oppressive since spectators usually do not get a chance to express themselves and that a collaboration between both parties , in contrast , allows spectators to perform actions that are socially liberating . the method , as boal liked to explain , seeks to transform spectators into `` spect-actors . '' when the political climate in brazil forced boal into exile in <year> , he initially went to peru and then argentina , where he completed and published his seminal theoretical work the theatre of the oppressed and consolidated his conscientização ( consciousness-raising ) theatre work based on the idea of brazilian educationalist paulo freire . freire 's methods were a revolt against the elitist `` top-down '' approach to education and he advocated critical-awareness-based education models . boal 's work in peru with the alfin project , a movement which sought to use a range of languages including `` artistic languages '' to eradicate illiteracy , developed his ideas and methodology away from the agit-prop of his brazilian arena theatre days and sought to engage theatre as a pedagogical tool . crucial to this time was boal 's attempts to break down the divisions between spectator and actor . it is around this time that invented the term `` spect-actor '' , a term that he saw as establishing the frameworks within which he wished to work . he saw that the passivity of the spectator could be broken down by the following steps by which the spectator becomes the spect-actor : knowing the body ( by body he means both the individual `` body '' and the collective `` body '' in a marxist sense ) making the body expressive using theatre as a language using theatre as discourseafter living in argentina , boal travelled to other countries in south america such as peru and ecuador , where he worked with people in small and usually poor communities that dealt with conflicts such as civil wars and lack of government attention . boal was of the opinion that only the oppressed are able to free the oppressed . in peru , boal practiced his forum theatre method , in which spectator replaces actor to determine the solution to a given problem presented by the actor , which can also be a real problem someone in the community is facing . boal also lived in paris , france , for a number of years , where he created several centers for the theatre of the oppressed , directed plays , and also taught classes at the sorbonne university . boal created the first international festival for the theatre of the oppressed in 1981.while boal was in exile , his very close friend and brazilian musician chico buarque wrote him a letter that would later result in the chorinho hit called `` meu caro amigo '' or `` my dear friend '' ( <year> ) . in this song , buarque tells his friend about the situation in brazil at the time , addressing the military dictatorship in a very subtle but clever way ( due to censorship issues , many artists could not express themselves freely ) . the melody of the song is very happy and upbeat while the lyrics explain : my dear friend , please forgive me , if i can ’ t pay you a visit , but since i found someone to carry a message , i ’ m sending you news on this tape . here we play football , there ’ s lots of samba , lots of choro and rock ’ n'roll . some days it rains , some days it ’ s sunny but i want to tell you that things here are pretty dark . here , we ’ re wheeling and dealing for survival , and we ’ re only surviving because we ’ re stubborn . and everyone ’ s drinking because without cachaça , nobody survives this squeeze . === center for the theatre of the oppressed-cto-brazil === after the fall of the military dictatorship , boal returned to brazil after <integer> years of exile in <year> . he established a major center for the theatre of the oppressed in rio de janeiro ( cto ) , whose objective was to study , discuss and express issues concerning citizenship , culture and various forms of oppression using theatrical language . boal 's work in the cto made way for the approval of a new law that protects crime victims and witnesses in brazil . boal 's group has worked next to numerous organizations that fight for human rights . in <year> , boal ran for city councillor in rio de janeiro as a theatrical act , and he was elected . boal 's support staff was his theatre group , with whom he quickly developed various legislative proposals . his objective was to work out issues citizens might be facing in their communities through theatre and also to discuss the laws of the city of rio with people on the streets . after having worked to transform spectator into author in theatre of the oppressed , boal initiates the legislative theatre movement process , in which voter becomes legislator . boal is known to say that he did not create laws arbitrarily while he was city councillor . instead , he asked people what they wanted . other politicians were not very fond of this . out of <integer> of boal 's proposed laws , only <integer> got approved during his term as councillor of rio de janeiro . his term ended in <year> , but he continued performing legislative theatre acts with different groups in brasília , where four more laws got approved even after boal had left . boal also worked with prisoners in rio and são paulo . boal argued that people in prison are not free in space , but that they are in time , and that the theatre of the oppressed strives to create different types of freedom so that people are able to imagine and think about the past , the present , and invent the future instead of having to wait for it . all this was in order for prisoners to have `` a healthier and more creative lifestyle . '' people in the movimento sem terra or landless workers movement of brazil also experienced working with boal 's theatre methods . boal 's son julián worked along with his father and now continues to take the theatre of the oppressed to various communities in brazil and around the world . <days> march <year> , he received the title of `` world theatre ambassador '' from unesco . === death === augusto boal died on <integer> may <year> at the age of <integer> in rio de janeiro . critic yan michalski argues that augusto boal is the best-known and most respected brazilian theatre practitioner abroad . == influences == most of augusto boal 's techniques were created after he realized the limitations of didactic , politically motivated theatre in the poor areas where he worked . he found that his attempts to inspire the people living in poor or `` slum '' areas to rise up against racial and class inequality were inhibited by his own racial and class background , since he was white and comparatively financially comfortable , as well as his and his colleagues ' inhibitions to perform violence themselves . his new techniques allowed the idea of rebellion and the impetus for change to come from within the target group . much of his early work and teaching was inspired by marxist philosophy , although much of his work now falls within the boundaries of a center-left ideology . paulo freire was a major influence on boal 's teachings . he and freire became close in later years . when freire died , boal said : `` i am very sad . i have lost my last father . now all i have are brothers and sisters '' .boal was also known to quote william shakespeare 's hamlet , in which hamlet argues that theatre is like a mirror that reflects our virtues and defects equally . although boal found this quote beautiful , he liked to think of theatre as a mirror in which one can reach in to change reality and to transform it . == published works == === theatre of the oppressed ( london : pluto press , <year> ) === arguably augusto boal 's most academically influential work is the theatre of the oppressed , in which the reader follows boal 's detailed analysis of the poetics of aristotle and the early history of western theatre . boal contends that the aristotelian ethic means oppressing the masses , the people , the workers and the spectators in favour of stability and the continued dominance of a privileged few . he argues that the tragi-drama , a formulaic drama style that today could be considered similar to that of soap operas , helps the state promote its continued existence . he sees the brazilian government as an example of an oppressive state using theatre to propagate its oppressive system . he then outlines his early theories and practices for attempting to reverse the paradigm . it also talks about newspaper theatre , attempting to talk about local problems and present it to the audiences , forum theatre , currently used in over <integer> countries , invisible theatre , used to discuss political activity and image theatre . theatre of the oppressed has been translated to more than <integer> languages over the years . boal also talks about invisible theatre in which an event is planned and scripted but does not allow the spectators to know that the event is happening . actors perform out of the ordinary roles which invite spectators to join in or sit back and watch . one example was in a restaurant at the chiclayo hotel , actors sat at separate tables and informed the waiters in loud voices that they could not eat the food . the actor stated that the food was not good . the waiter says the diner could pick something else to eat . so the actor chose a rather expensive item off the menu and says he will be able to pay for it . the actor mentions he has no money and he would be willing to work for it . this display made other diners start discussing the price and treatment of workers at this hotel . this act allowed spectators to think about issues that were going on but was brushed over because the issue did not directly involve them . analytical theatre is when a participant tells a story and the actors improvise it . each character is broken down into all the social roles they could follow and the participants choose an object to symbolize the role . this aspect of theatre allows the participants to see how there are multiple roles a person could follow . === games for actors and non-actors ( london : routledge , <year> ; second edition <year> ) === this is probably augusto boal 's most practically influential book , in which he sets down a brief explanation of his theories , mostly through stories and examples of his work in europe , and then explains every drama exercise that he has found useful in his practice . in contrast to theatre of the oppressed , it contains little academic theory and many practical examples for drama practitioners to use even if not practising theatre that is related to boal 's academic or political ideas . boal refers to many of these as `` gamesercises '' , as they combine the training and `` introversion '' of exercises with the fun and `` extroversion '' of games . it has been influential in the development of community theatre and theatre in education ( t.i.e . ) practices worldwide , especially in europe and south america . these games include carnival in rio and your friend is dead . === the rainbow of desire : the boal method of theatre and therapy . ( london : routledge , <year> ) === this book re-evaluates the practices commonly associated with the theatre of the oppressed for a new purpose . it has been argued that boal contradicts himself with this take on his work , as it mostly concerns itself with creating harmony within society , whereas his early work was concerned with rebellion and upheaval . boal states that , `` theatre is the passionate combat of two human beings on a platform . '' however , boal 's works can be seen as a progression and exploration of a left wing world view rather than a unified theory . in the context of those under-represented in a society , his methodology can be used as a weapon against oppressors . in the context of those in a society who are in need of catharsis for the sake of their own integration into it , it can be switched round to empower that individual to break down internal oppressions that separate that individual from society . through his work at french institutions for the mentally ill and elsewhere in europe , where he discovered concepts such as the `` cop in the head '' , the theories presented in this book have been useful in the pioneering field of drama therapy and have been applied by drama practitioners . boal states in his work that there are three properties of the aesthetic space . first , is plasticity . he says that one can be without being . objects can acquire different meaning such as an old chair representing a king 's throne . he states that only duration counts and location can be changed . second , is that the aesthetic space is dichotomic and it creates dichotomy . this idea suggests that there is a space within a space . the stage is in front of the audience and the actor is creating his own space . third , is telemicroscopic . this idea creates the idea that it is impossible to hide on stage . every aspect of the space is seen and it makes the far away close-up . === other books === legislative theatre : using performance to make politics . london : routledge , <year> .

democracy by dundalk institute of technology in <year> . boal has in many ways influenced many artists in new media with his participatory modes of expression , especially as the world wide web has become such a powerful tool for participation and communication . notable examples include learning to love you more , happenings , and steve lambert 's why they hate us . == see also == applied drama

pronounced [ jɪˈɡor tʲɪˈmurəvʲɪtɕ ɡɐjˈdar ] ; <integer> march <year> – <integer> december <year> ) was a soviet and russian economist , politician , and author , and was the acting prime minister of russia from <integer> june <year> to <integer> december <year> . he was the architect of the controversial shock therapy reforms administered in russia after the dissolution of the soviet union , which brought him both praise and harsh criticism . he participated in the preparation of the bialowieza agreements . many russians held him responsible for the economic hardships that plagued the country in the 1990s that resulted in mass poverty and hyperinflation among other things , although liberals praised him as a man who did what had to be done to save the country from complete collapse . jeffrey sachs , director of columbia university 's earth institute , who advised the russian government in the early 1990s , called gaidar `` the intellectual leader of many of russia 's political and economic reforms '' and `` one of the few pivotal actors '' of the period.gaidar died of pulmonary edema , provoked by myocardial ischemia on <integer> december <year> . == personal life == gaidar was born in <year> in moscow , rsfsr , soviet union , the son of ariadna bazhova and pravda military correspondent timur gaidar , who fought in the bay of pigs invasion and was a friend of raúl castro . his paternal grandfather was soviet writer arkady gaidar and his maternal grandfather was writer pavel bazhov . despite the turkic-sounding surname , gaidar was russian ; his grandfather , originally called `` golikov '' , adopted the name `` gaidar '' from the khakas language as a nom-de-plume . gaidar married the daughter of writer arkady strugatsky during his time at the university . his daughter , maria gaidar , was one of the leaders of the russian democratic opposition . from july <year> till june <year> she was deputy chair of the government of kirov oblast . in <year> and <year> she was vice-governor of odessa oblast in ukraine . == career == gaidar graduated with honors from the moscow state university , faculty of economics , in <year> and worked as a researcher in several academic institutes . a long-time member of the communist party of the soviet union and an editor of the cpsu ideological journal communist during the perestroika , he joined boris yeltsin 's camp during perestroika . in <year> he quit the communist party and was promoted to yeltsin 's government . while in government , gaidar advocated free market economic reforms according to the principle of shock therapy . his best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state , which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially authorizing a market economy in russia . he also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies , and reduced the budget deficit . gaidar was the first vice-premier of the russian government and minister of economics from <year> until <year> , and minister of finance from february <year> until april <year> . he was appointed acting prime minister under president boris yeltsin in <year> from <integer> june until <integer> december <days> when the anti-yeltsin russian congress of people 's deputies refused to confirm gaidar in this position and viktor chernomyrdin was eventually chosen as a compromise figure . gaidar continued to advise the new government . on <integer> september <year> , he was again appointed the first vice-premier under chernomyrdin as a deliberate snub to the opposition . he played an active role in the russian constitutional crisis of <year> . on <integer> october <days> he famously spoke live on russian television , then broadcasting from an emergency station near moscow , as there was fighting going on in the ostankino complex , calling on muscovites to gather to defend yeltsin 's government so that russia would not be `` turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades '' .in the <year> duma elections , in the aftermath of the crisis , gaidar led the pro-government bloc russia 's choice and was seen by some as a possible future prime minister . however , due to the bloc 's failure to win the plurality of votes in the election , gaidar 's role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on <integer> january <year> . during the <year> nato bombing of yugoslavia yegor gaidar , boris nemtsov and boris fyodorov were in belgrade , yugoslavia on a mediation mission . === reforms controversy === gaidar was often criticized for imposing ruthless reforms in <year> with little care for their social impact ; however , it has to be understood that the country back then was at the brink of a famine . russia had no currency for buying import goods , at the same time , no-one gave credits as the country was essentially bankrupt . the collapse of the soviet social system led to serious deterioration in living standards . millions of russians were thrown into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive hyperinflation . moreover , the privatization and break-up of state assets left over from the soviet union , which he played a big part in , led to much of the country 's wealth being handed to a small group of powerful business executives , later known as the russian oligarchs , for much less than what they were worth . the voucher privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become billionaires specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market . because they stashed billions of dollars in swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the russian economy , these oligarchs were dubbed `` kleptocrats . '' as society grew to despise these figures and resent the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms , gaidar was often held by russians as one of the men most responsible . on the other hand , the ubiquitous goods deficit of the soviet years disappeared and it became possible to buy all goods in the shops . per capita calorie consumption under gaidar diminished by 3.5 % from 2526.88 kcal to 2438.17 kcal.according to franklin foer writing in the atlantic , however , `` when yegor gaidar ... asked the united states for help hunting down the billions that the kgb had carted away , the white house refused . `` one of gaidar 's most outspoken critics was the yabloko economist and mp grigory yavlinsky , who had proposed since <year> a <integer> days programme for the transition of the whole ussr to market economic , which was first backed and then dismissed by the government of nikolai ryzhkov . yavlinsky emphasized the differences between his and gaidar 's reforms program , such as the sequencing of privatization vs. liberalization of prices and the applicability of his program to the entire soviet union . gaidar 's supporters contend that although many mistakes were made , he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from bankruptcy and from starvation . according to the bbc 's andrei ostalski , `` there were only two solutions—either introduce martial law and severe rationing , or radically liberalize the economy . the first option meant going all the way back to the stalinist system of mass repression . the second meant a colossal change , a journey—or , rather , a race—through uncharted waters with an unpredictable outcome . '' === poisoning case === <days> november <year> gaidar went to dublin , ireland to present his book 'death of the empire : lessons for modern russia ' at an academic conference . shortly after breakfast , a fruit salad and a cup of tea , gaidar felt sick and returned from the conference hall to his room at the hotel . then he was called on the phone to come down and deliver his speech , what gaidar has later recalled as a call that saved his life , as he must had certainly died if were left in his room unattended . after gaidar had tried to deliver his speech he collapsed in the university hallway and was urgently taken a to local hospital . his colleague , ekaterina genieva , recalled that `` he was lying on the floor unconscious . there was blood coming from his nose ; he was vomiting blood . this went on for more than half an hour '' .next day he moved from the hospital to the russian embassy 's premises and arranged a transfer to moscow where the doctors familiar with his health status suggested that it looks like he was 'poisoned'.in a later interview that was published in the ft gaidar claimed that this has been an attempted political murder , where `` most likely that means that some obvious or hidden adversaries of the russian authorities stand behind the scenes of this event , those who are interested in further radical deterioration of relations between russia and the west '' .another russian reformist official and former colleague of gaidar , anatoly chubais rejected a possibility of kremlin 's involvement in this case , commenting that `` yegor gaidar was on the verge of death on <integer> november <days> the deadly triangle - politkovskaya , litvinenko and gaidar - would have been very desirable for some people who are seeking an unconstitutional and forceful change of power in russia . '' irish police opened an official investigation of the case . one of the versions voiced by the russian opposition leaders and kremlin supporters suggested that boris berezovsky , then a russian oligarch in exile <days> may have been behind it . andrey illarionov , former putin 's adviser now living in the us , commented that the whole case was staged , and the reason for taking gaidar to hospital must have been hyperthensia , stress or alcohol . == death == gaidar died at the age of <integer> in odintsovo raion , moscow oblast , russia . gaidar 's aide valery natarov stated that gaidar died unexpectedly , early on <integer> december <year> , at his moscow oblast home while he was working on a book for children . gaidar died of pulmonary edema , provoked by myocardial ischemia . he is survived by his wife , three sons and daughter.gaidar was regarded as an object of loathing among ordinary russians who lost everything during the shock therapy economic reforms.exiled russian oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky and convicted fraudster platon lebedev expressed their condolences . `` he laid the foundation of our economy '' .russian president dmitry medvedev has expressed condolences to relatives and friends of yegor gaidar . medvedev called gaidar a `` daring , honest and decisive '' economist who `` evoked respect among his supporters and opponents . '' `` the death of gaidar is a heavy loss for russia , '' says russian prime minister vladimir putin . `` we have lost a genuine citizen and patriot , a strong spirited person , a talented scientist , writer and expert .... he did n't dodge responsibility and 'took the punch ' in the most challenging situations with honor and courage , '' the statement said.the white house offered condolences over gaidar 's death . u.s. national security council spokesman mike hammer said that , although controversial , gaidar 's legacy formed the foundation of a dynamic market-based economy . === gaidar forum === in honor of yegor gaidar , each year in mid-january the russian presidency holds the gaidar forum that attracts the russian political and business elite , with top european politicians also

a united states senator from indiana and later an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states . he was a member of the democratic party . after attending college and law school , minton served as a captain in world war i , following which he launched a legal and political career . in <year> , after multiple failed election attempts , and serving as a regional leader in the american legion , he became a utility commissioner under the administration of indiana governor paul v. mcnutt . four years later minton was elected to the united states senate . during the campaign , he defended new deal legislation in a series of addresses in which he suggested it was not necessary to uphold the united states constitution during the great depression . minton 's campaign was denounced by his political opponents , and he received more widespread criticism for an address that became known as the `` you can not eat the constitution '' speech . as part of the new deal coalition , minton championed president franklin d. roosevelt 's unsuccessful court packing plans in the senate and became one of his top senate allies . after minton failed in his <year> senate reelection bid , roosevelt appointed him as a united states circuit judge of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit . after roosevelt 's death , president harry s. truman , who had developed a close friendship with minton during their time together in the senate , nominated him to the supreme court . he was confirmed by the senate on october <days> , <year> , by a vote of <integer> to <integer> , <integer> republicans and one democrat ( harry flood byrd of virginia ) voting against him . he served on the supreme court for seven years . an advocate of judicial restraint , minton was a regular supporter of the majority opinions during his early years on the court ; he became a regular dissenter after president dwight eisenhower 's appointees altered the court 's composition . in <year> , poor health forced minton to retire , after which he traveled and lectured until his death in <year> . according to historians , minton 's judicial philosophy was largely a reaction to the relationship between the new deal senators and the conservative 1930s court , which ruled much of the new deal legislation unconstitutional . minton believed the supreme court should be more deferential to the political branches of government , and supported a broad interpretation of the powers of congress . he generally opposed any effort to rule federal legislation unconstitutional on the principle that the court was overstepping its authority . as a result of his judicial philosophy , he sought to uphold the intent of the political branches of government . historians note the unusual contrast this created between his role as a partisan liberal senator and his role as a conservative jurist . when minton became a justice , the senate had become more conservative , leading minton to uphold the constitutionality and intention of conservative legislation . he often played peacemaker and consensus builder during a period when the court was riven by feuds . he generally ruled in favor of order over freedom as a result of his broad interpretation of governmental powers . these rulings and their limited impact gave some historians a negative opinion of his judicial record . other historians consider minton 's strong commitment to his judicial principles laudable . in <year> , the sherman minton bridge in southern indiana and the minton-capehart federal building in indianapolis were named in his honor . == early life == === family and background === sherman minton was born on october <days> , <year> , to john evan and emma livers minton , in their georgetown , indiana , home . he was the third of the family 's five children and was nicknamed shay because of his younger brother 's inability to properly pronounce ``

education in a two-room schoolhouse in georgetown he attended through eighth grade . he was exposed to politics from an early age ; his father took him to several political rallies , including an <year> speech by democratic party leader william jennings bryan . his father was a day laborer for the new albany and st. louis air line railway . in <year> , he became disabled when he suffered heat stroke while working . his condition meant he could not work ; the family became impoverished and had to subsist on the limited yield of their small farm . minton 's mother developed breast cancer in <year> . a traveling doctor attempted to remove her tumors <days> april <year> , performing the operation with her laid on the family dinner table , but she died during the procedure . the death was an emotional blow to minton ; thereafter , he refused to attend church and spoke against god , whom he blamed for his mother 's death . minton 's father married sarah montague on december <days> , 1901.as minton grew older , he was frequently in trouble with people in his neighborhood . in <year> he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk . he was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars , an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer . to accomplish that , and continue supporting his family , he traveled with his older brother herbert to fort worth , texas , to take a job at the swift and company meatpacking plant . his father and younger siblings soon joined him there after the two brothers ' income was able to cover their expenses . after saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home , minton returned to indiana to attend high school , leaving his family in texas . === education === minton started at edwardsville high school in <year> , aged <integer> . the next year the school merged with nearby new albany high school . there he participated in the football , baseball , and track teams . he founded the school 's first debate club , the wranglers , which won several awards . he worked in a local arcade , and during summer vacations returned to fort worth to work at the swift plant . he was briefly expelled from school after committing a prank <days> february <year> . the school was under the guidance of the innovative superintendent charles allen prosser , who let minton return only after he formally apologized before the entire school a week later . minton began dating gertrude gurtz in his senior year , and the two remained in regular correspondence after he left for college . he graduated high school at the top of his class in 1910.minton was intent on attending college ; during the summer of <year> , he took a job as a swift company salesman in the fort worth area to help pay his way . he returned to indiana and enrolled at indiana university bloomington <days> september <year> , taking enough classes to complete his first three years of courses in two years . despite the heavy workload , he joined the school 's baseball and debate teams , and participated in the jackson club , an

during law school , he played end and fullback for the indiana university football team.minton ranked first in his class . this placement entitled him to serve as librarian at the legal college . the position paid a fair salary and allowed him to live more comfortably for his last two years of school . he graduated from law school in <year> , again at the top of his class , and won a one-year scholarship to take post-graduate courses at yale law school , where he earned a master of laws degree . at yale he focused on studying constitutional law and attended the regular lectures of former president and future chief justice of the united states william howard taft . his ll.m . thesis at yale was titled `` theory of the action . '' taft said that minton 's post-graduate thesis was among the best he had ever read . along with lewis f. powell jr. , minton is one of two united states supreme court justices to have earned an ll.m . degree . minton continued to improve his oratory and debate at yale ; he won the wayland club prize for extemporaneous public speaking , and helped organize the university 's legal aid society . === legal career and world war i === <days> may <year> , minton returned to new albany , where he opened a law practice and renewed his relationship with gurtz . he took several cases and gained experience working pro bono to assist the local county prosecutor . he joined the chautauqua lecture circuit , and traveled to several cities to give speeches . during one lecture circuit , he met william jennings bryan , who advised minton about politics , inspiring him to consider a career in public life.in <year> , just after the united states declared war on germany and entered world war i , minton enlisted in the united states army . he took an officers training course at fort benjamin harrison in hope of earning a commission , but was not among those chosen to become an officer . in august <days> was granted a brief leave of absence ; he returned to new albany , where he married gurtz on august <days> . he returned to camp <days> september and requested to repeat his training

minton 's three children , sherman jr. , was born while he was away . minton 's daughter mary-anne was born in <year> , and his second son , john , in <year> . == political career == when minton returned home he reopened his law practice and decided to enter politics . he ran for office in indiana 's 3rd congressional district , but lost the democratic primary , despite significant campaigning and his war record . he lost to john ewing , 6,502 votes to 3,170 , second place in a field of five candidates . after the loss , he briefly joined the indiana law firm of stonsenburg and weathers , two politically active lawyers , before moving to miami , florida , where he joined another firm , shutts & bowen . <days> january <year> , he left the miami practice and returned to stonsenburg and weathers . he attempted to secure the democratic nomination to run for congress in <year> , but was again defeated , this time by the former state party chairman eugene b. crowe . the following year , minton became a local commander of the american legion . the group had a large and active membership in the state at the time , and he used his position to encourage support of the democratic party agenda . paul mcnutt was the national commander , and the two men became political allies . when mcnutt became governor in <year> , he offered minton a position at the head of a new utility regulation commission . as commissioner , minton successfully imposed regulations that reduced state telephone bills by a combined total of $ 525,000 . the cuts received widespread media coverage , and minton was credited in the reports with the success . === senate campaign === becoming popular among the party leadership during his two years as commissioner , minton was encouraged by party leaders to run for the united states senate in <year> . at the state democratic party convention he ran against earl peters , a former chairman of the state party . with the support of mcnutt , minton won the nomination on the third ballot with <integer> votes to peters ' 586.minton launched a statewide campaign <days> august <year> and began delivering speeches in defense of the new deal . he blamed republicans for the conditions of the great depression . his opponent , incumbent republican senator arthur raymond robinson , accused minton of playing `` santa claus '' by trying to give everyone `` presents '' . he also criticized minton 's support of the new deal , which robinson and republicans called unconstitutional . minton 's initial campaign slogan was `` you ca n't offer a hungry man the constitution '' , a slogan he unveiled in a debate with robinson in corydon on august <days> . he continued using the slogan , and on september <days> , minton delivered his infamous `` you can not eat the constitution '' speech , in which he concluded the urgent needs of the masses outweighed the need to uphold the constitution . the speech backfired wildly and papers and opponents across the state called minton 's remarks traitorous . minton stopped using the slogan and explained his position again using new terms , but his opponents continued to dog him over the issue . the republicans also faulted popular governor mcnutt and his reorganization of the government , and mcnutt became more personally involved in the election . with the state party 's more direct involvement , minton won the election with <integer> percent of the vote . === lobby investigation committee === minton took his senate seat <days> january <year> . as a freshman , he sat in the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman harry truman , and the pair quickly became friends . minton was made a member of a special lobby investigation committee chaired by senator hugo black , that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups . according to professor of political science linda c. gugin , a minton biographer , in practice the committee 's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging new deal legislation.william randolph hearst , a prominent and wealthy media magnate , began using his newspapers to deride the committee 's `` reckless attacks on freedom '' . minton led the effort to counter hearst and delivered a speech criticizing his support of the republican party . in <year> , senator black was appointed to the supreme court and left the senate , and minton secured his post as chair of the committee . minton immediately began a full-scale investigation of the media conglomerate controlled by frank e. gannett , accusing him of publishing republican party propaganda . for several weeks , minton delivered speeches against gannett in the senate , and gannett responded in kind in his newspapers . minton finally introduced legislation that would have made it `` illegal to publish information known to be false '' . gannett , and a large number of allies in newspapers and on radio , immediately began to charge minton and the democratic party with an assault on the freedom of the press . minton 's allies in congress asked him to withdraw the bill because of its political repercussions , and he dropped the matter.minton tried again to expose what he believed to be republican control of the media . he led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation , rural progress . minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting large sums of money from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money . the owner of the paper , maurive v. renolds , was summoned before the committee for a hearing , where minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations . when renolds asked his manager , dr. glen frank , to help him answer the questions , minton and fellow democratic senators began to shout dr. frank down . as he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine , minton beat his gavel and yelled , `` this committee does n't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your republican views . `` minton did not realize that frank was also president of the university of wisconsin , and soon suffered retaliation for the way he had treated frank . frank went on nbc radio stations around the country and lambasted minton for his rudeness . he made lengthy arguments accusing minton of attempting to violate the bill of rights . minton was outraged , but the arguments had an effect among voters in indiana . in <year> , he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of republican interference in the press . democratic senator edward r. burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused minton of damaging the democrats ' cause , which led minton to leave the lobby investigation committee.minton was a fierce partisan during his time in the senate , and regularly abused his opponents verbally . democratic senator huey long became one of minton 's favorite targets because of long 's often-threatened filibusters . during one of the filibusters , long threatened to join the republican party . after most senators had left the chamber , minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt long . after tiring of the taunts , long launched a rebuttal from the podium , calling minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost minton re-election . the exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.minton was involved in many such exchanges , including a particularly fierce one with republican senator lester j. dickinson <days> march <year> . dickinson delivered a speech in the senate castigating president franklin d. roosevelt for carrying out what he termed illegal and unconstitutional acts . minton responded with a range of accusations , some personal , against dickinson and his `` political naivety '' . === court packing === in <year> , the united states supreme court ruled the agricultural adjustment act of <year> unconstitutional . for the first time , minton gave speeches criticizing the court for overriding the will of congress . he accused the court of allowing itself to be influenced by political motives rather than the law . in response to the court ruling , minton began drafting a bill which would allow the supreme court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision . <days> february <year> , before minton introduced his bill , president roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the supreme court . roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age ; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court , more sympathetic to his agenda , ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.minton was pleased with roosevelt 's bill and quickly became its leading supporter in the senate . the measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting , among many other measures . republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill . democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in congress , and passage of the bill at first seemed assured . minton 's support of the bill helped him earn the position of senate majority whip , allowing him to more effectively push for its passage . minton delivered six radio addresses on behalf of his party in support of the bill , but public opinion could not be swayed in the democrats ' favor.minton received a death threat in the form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan . many democrats , fearing their re-election prospects , joined with republicans and defeated the bill . minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters , but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party , he gained more influence with the democrats.although minton supported the roosevelt administration and became a regular guest at the white house , minton opposed the president on some measures . he voted to override a presidential veto of a grant of $ 2.5 billion ( $ <integer> billion in <year> dollars ) in bonus pay for world war i soldiers ( bonus army ) . he supported the dyer anti-lynching bill , which roosevelt feared would cost the party support in the southern states . he also supported an extension of the hatch act of <year> , a law that prevented federal employees from being forced to take part in state election campaigns , effectively lessening the influence of federal patronage.as world war ii neared , minton took a cautious position on united states involvement . when the soviet union invaded finland , minton voted against granting a loan to finland to help finance its defense efforts . he also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the allies or the axis powers . he advocated and supported expanding the american military and believed that american entry into the war was inevitable , but should be delayed as long as possible . he voted in favor of the smith act , which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government , a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the united states . in his final year in office , there was considerable speculation in the press that minton would be named to higher office by roosevelt , including cabinet positions and the supreme court , but neither happened . === re-election campaign === minton ran for re-election to his senate seat in <year> . mcnutt was challenging roosevelt for the presidential nomination , forcing minton to choose between the administration and his allies in the state party . minton sided with roosevelt , which cost him mcnutt 's and the indiana democratic party machine 's support in his re-election bid.the republican presidential candidate , wendell willkie was also a native of indiana , and minton faced a difficult challenge to win re-election . he referred to willkie as a `` sycophant for the rich and famous '' . willkie never responded to minton 's taunts , leaving minton 's opponent in the senate race , raymond e. willis , to do so in his stead . willis had run for the senate two years earlier but was defeated by democrat frederick van nuys . willis faulted minton on a range of topics but focused on the legislation minton supported while in the senate . willis claimed that much of the legislation was unconstitutional and minton 's positions were detrimental to the nation . minton responded by pointing out willis 's connections to wealthy corporations and accused him of not caring for the people . minton 's campaign focused on the achievements of the new deal programs . he claimed farm income in indiana had doubled since <year> , and highlighted the passage of the old age pension laws . his support for conscription and military preparedness for the coming war proved unpopular with voters and cost him considerable support , but according to historian william radcliff it was willkie 's favorite son status , which led many hoosiers to vote republican , that proved to be the election 's deciding factor . despite minton 's heavy campaigning , he lost the close election to willis by 5,179 votes out of over 1.5 million cast.roosevelt won the <year> presidential election . after minton left office <days> january <year> , he was given a position in the roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure . he served as one of the president 's advisers and a liaison between the white house and congress . the extent of his duties is not fully known ; linda gugin has speculated that <days> may have managed roosevelt 's patronage system . minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions . he also convinced roosevelt to support the creation of a senate defense committee chaired by truman , a position that brought truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency . == seventh circuit == === appointment === on may <days> , <year> , roosevelt announced minton 's nomination to the chicago-based united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit . minton was confirmed unanimously by the senate on may <days> , <year> , and received his commission on may <days> , <year> . minton resigned from his post in the administration , but even after he began working on the court , minton remained active in democratic politics behind the scenes and was in regular correspondence with roosevelt to make patronage suggestions.minton took his oath of office on may <days> , <year> , but the court was in recess at the time . he took his seat when it returned to session on october <days> , <year> . the court had the highest court load of all the appellate courts in the nation at that time , averaging <integer> cases per judge annually . the men on the court were close friends , and minton developed a particularly close friendship with judge j. earl major ; major offered minton financial assistance during his later illnesses . major had been on the court for several years and held a judicial philosophy similar to minton 's . the two men regularly attended baseball games and were frequent guests in each other 's homes.world war ii broke out shortly after minton joined the court , creating a flood of cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance , including challenges to wartime measures , selective service laws , price controls , rationing and civil liberties . in the majority of these cases , the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts , but in several the court was required to establish a precedent . minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts . he believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts ' decisions . he believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake . === jurisprudence === minton was described by william radcliff as a `` faithful disciple of judicial restraint , '' an unexpected development when compared to his overtly partisan political career . radcliff attributed minton 's conservative position to the distaste he developed for the courts when they overturned legislation passed while he was in the senate . the courts ' actions led him to strongly believe in the limited exercise of judicial power when evaluating the constitutionality of governmental conduct . much of the recently passed new deal legislation was being tried in the courts for constitutionality and enforcement , putting minton in the uncommon position of adjudicating cases which depended on legislation he had helped write.during his time on the seventh circuit , minton authored <integer> of the court 's opinions , including twelve dissenting opinions . some of his opinions won praise ; the editors of tax magazine commented favorably on minton 's opinions on tax law , calling them `` direct hoosier logic '' . other court reporting papers made similar comments , applauding the manner in which he turned complex issues to simple questions that could easily be understood.in the cases of sunkist v. sunkist and quaker oats co. v. general mills , the court held that it was possible for different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products . in another case , the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive . after minton joined the united states supreme court , the decision was appealed to that body ; minton recused himself from the case , which the court decided to overturn . in another decision , minton was in the majority that ruled under the sherman antitrust act that the new york great atlantic and pacific tea company was a monopoly , ordering the company to break up its grocery business . minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the national labor relations board , usually to end worker strikes.in the case of united states v. knauer , the government denied the wife of a united states citizen entry into the country because of her possible ties to nazism . in a much-criticized majority opinion which minton co-authored with judge major , he stated that the `` alien did not have any legal right— [ her ] status was a political decision to be made by officials in government . '' many liberals condemned the court at the time of the decision . the ruling was upheld by the supreme court in a <year> appeal.one of minton 's favorite cases was that of modernistic candies , inc. v. federal trade commission . the candy company produced a one-cent gumball dispenser in which almost all the gumballs were the same color . a few different-colored gumballs were included which , when dispensed , entitled the purchaser to a prize from the merchant who owned the machine . the ftc had an injunction put in place barring the company from producing the machines because they claimed it violated anti-gambling laws . minton wrote the majority opinion and sided with the majority to keep the injunction in place , but dryly mocked the counsel for the defense and the gambling law , stating : counsel for the petitioner discussed at great length from a sociological point of view , of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being . according to his analysis , gambling pervades our entire economic system ; thus insurance contracts are a gamble , stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles , and the farmer 's dependence on weather is a gamble . counsel 's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed . he even reminded us that our great idol , mr. chief justice john marshall , in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman . in fact , they ran a book . as indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy , we confess we do not even know a bookmaker , clerical or otherwise , and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around chicago lie in our desk unused . minton often lamented that he was required to `` pronounce the law as it was written , but on no occasion [ c ] ould he make the law . '' === clemency board and failing health === after roosevelt 's death and truman 's succession to the presidency , minton continued offering advice to the new administration on a range of topics , including patronage and political maneuvering . truman appointed minton as head of the war department clemency board , a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial . the panel met every two weeks which , along with his responsibilities on the circuit court , kept minton very busy and afforded him little rest , leading to a deterioration in his health . while yachting with president truman on memorial day in <year> , truman asked minton to accept an appointment to the position of solicitor general of the united states . minton declined because of his health , but he told truman he would be interested in a seat on the supreme court.in september <year> , minton suffered a heart attack while in washington ; he was hospitalized for three months at walter reed hospital . after returning to work , he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia , and he sought to lessen his workload . to further complicate his health , on august <days> , <year> , minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg . the injury forced him to walk with a cane for the remainder of his life . == supreme court == === nomination and confirmation === at a september <days> , <year> , news conference , truman announced minton 's nomination to the supreme court , succeeding the late justice wiley rutledge . minton had already privately accepted the nomination several days earlier after a telephone conversation with truman . truman touted minton 's extensive law education and his years of experience on the circuit courts as the reason for his nomination . news of minton 's appointment received mixed reviews nationally . the new york times said that truman had allowed personal and political friendship to influence his choice . the new republic said `` the president is again reverting to his deplorable habit of choosing men for high post because they happen to be his friends .... '' the washington post raised questions about minton 's ability to be confirmed by the senate due to the power many of his foes held in the body . the indianapolis star offered a more sympathetic opinion , pointing out minton 's qualifications and the pride indiana could take in having a native on the supreme court . the article noted that he would be the most educated justice on the court , should he be confirmed.indiana senator william e. jenner led opponents of minton 's nomination , including some of minton 's old foes , in an attempt to bring him before the body for hearings . minton wrote a letter to the senate judicial committee answering several of their questions , but refused to submit himself to a hearing . he mentioned his broken leg and hinted in his letter that it could be detrimental to his health to travel in his condition . he also stated that , as a sitting judge and former member of the senate , it would be improper for him submit to a hearing . although hearings had occurred irregularly in the past , it was not customary at that time to have a hearing on a nominee . during an absence of jenner 's , minton 's allies worked to have the hearing request dropped and the judicial committee sent the measure to the full senate in a vote of <integer> to <integer> . senator homer s. ferguson attempted to have the nomination returned to committee but the motion failed , 45–21 . the long debate over minton 's appointment focused on his partisanship , support of the court packing plan during his time in the senate , and poor health . his opponents launched numerous delaying tactics ; the senate session before the vote to confirm minton lasted until midnight . his confirmation was approved 48–16 on october <days> , <year> and he received his commission on october <days> , <year> . to date , minton remains the last member of congress , sitting or former , to be appointed to the united states supreme court , and he is the only native of indiana to be appointed to the court . === judicial restraint === minton 's central judicial philosophy was to ascertain and uphold the original intent of legislation . he continued to take a broad view of governmental powers , demonstrated in his dissenting vote in the case of youngstown sheet & tube co. v. sawyer , which ruled unconstitutional president truman 's wartime seizure of several steel mills to avert a workers ' strike . of all the cases in which minton was involved , he disagreed most with the youngstown decision and `` went into a tirade '' during the conference where the decision was made . he argued that there `` could be no vacant spot in power when the security of the nation is at stake . '' despite his strong protest , he could not influence the court to permit the president to seize the plants without congressional approval . minton joined with chief justice fred m. vinson and justice stanley forman reed in the dissenting opinion that the president had the authority through the war powers clause of the constitution . minton abhorred racial segregation and provided a solid vote to strike down the school segregation practices at issue in <year> 's landmark case of brown v. board of education ; it was among the few decisions in which he sided against the government . according to william radcliff , the majority opinion authored by minton in the <year> case barrows v. jackson was his most skillfully written opinion . he framed the complex question of the case as : `` can a racially restrictive covenant be enforced at law by a suit for damages against a co-covenantor who allegedly broke the covenant ? '' the court decided the answer in the negative.in the area of civil liberties , minton adhered to the doctrine of `` fundamental fairness '' , a test established by the supreme court in <year> . in one decision , minton stated that the right of free speech was not an absolute right , and could be regulated so as not to violate the rights of others . in united states v. rabinowitz , minton wrote the court 's opinion upholding a lower court ruling which allowed police to search automobiles without a warrant , provided there was probable cause to justify the search.minton voted to uphold anticommunist legislation during the period of the `` red scare '' , siding with the majority in <year> 's dennis v. united states , which upheld the conviction of the leader of the us communist party . during the same period , the court was split over the legality of governmental loyalty tests . many agencies had programs in place to ensure that members of the government were not communists . minton 's vote proved to be the deciding factor in cases regarding loyalty tests . in the case of bailey v. richardson , minton 's vote upheld the legality of the loyalty tests , while in the decision he authored in the case of joint anti-fascist refugee committee v. mcgrath , he voted to uphold the plaintiff 's position that he had been terminated illegally because of his support of fascist ideology . minton 's position gradually shifted to allowing the loyalty tests to take place , and in adler v. board of ed . of city of new york he wrote the majority opinion allowing the tests and upholding new york 's feinberg law . this proved to be the most important vote as it allowed the tests to be given with only minimal suspicion of a person 's disloyalty to the government.because of minton 's previous congressional partisanship , many liberals believed he would support their positions when on the court . throughout his tenure , minton regularly disappointed them , leading many to rail against him . a lawyer writing for the new jersey law journal labeled minton a `` spokesman against freedom '' , calling him `` a man of conspicuous judicial shortcomings , whose votes against civil liberties exceeded those of any other man on the court , and who wrote comparatively few opinions of other kinds . '' linda gugin pointed out that minton was a disappointment to liberals because he consistently chose order over freedom . gugin also concludes that minton had the strongest commitment to judicial restraint and ideological neutrality of any justice , past or present . === politics === although minton was on the supreme court , he remained casually involved in democratic internal politics . he wrote truman several letters criticizing justices robert h. jackson and hugo black , referring to black as a demagogue . he also offered advice on dealing with republican opposition in the senate . in a <year> letter , after truman left office , he urged truman to help focus public attention on the economy and away from communism , a threat he claimed the republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.after truman 's withdrawal from the <year> presidential campaign , minton made remarks indicating he had advised truman to stay out of the contested new hampshire primary election to begin with . <days> august <year> , a reporter asked minton about his preferred candidate in the upcoming presidential election . minton answered , `` i have great confidence in adlai stevenson . '' he also remarked that dwight d. eisenhower was politically handicapped . minton was lambasted in the media for his endorsement , which he attempted to retract a few days later after being advised to do so by other members of the court . === regular dissenter === truman 's other appointees to the court provided consistent conservative votes , and during minton 's first years on the court it was returned to the conservatism of the william howard taft era . while on the court , minton transformed from a new deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of justice felix frankfurter . empirical coding of votes shows that minton was the most conservative justice on the court during his first year , and remained in the conservative half of the court for the duration of his career.minton did not enjoy the limited influence of his judicial role in the later years of his term , when he was more frequently in the minority in voting on cases . after the deaths of chief justice fred m. vinson and justice robert jackson , minton found himself with little support for many of his opinions , which led him to begin considering retirement.the shifting position of the court led to personal animosity between members of its two wings . despite his disappointment over the court 's positions on some issues , minton remained popular among his colleagues on the court as he did n't take sides in their personal disagreements ; he proved a soothing presence during a period marked by bitter personal feuds between strong personalities such as william o. douglas and felix frankfurter.minton informed eisenhower of his intention to retire in a letter on september <days> , <year> , in which he dryly stated his retirement was authorized by law . eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement . although he did not tell the president , minton informed the members of the court that his duties were too taxing on his health . his anemia had steadily worsened , slowing him physically and mentally . minton served as a justice until october <days> , <year> , retiring after <integer> years and <integer> days of service . he was succeeded by william j. brennan jr. == later life == === retirement === announcing his departure , minton remarked , `` there will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing . i 'm an echo . '' despite the health difficulties , minton regretted his decision almost immediately.minton returned to his new albany home , where he took a much lighter workload . he gave occasional lectures at indiana university and continued to give public speeches from time to time . for several years after retiring from the supreme court , minton occasionally accepted assignments to serve temporarily on one of the lower federal courts . he received an honorary doctorate degree from the university of louisville . he took many trips around the united states , and two trips to europe . in england , he received an honorary doctorate from oxford university in 1956.despite his failing health , minton remained active in the democratic party . he was most concerned with president eisenhower , who he believed was incompetent . he remained in regular correspondence with truman , and the two met on several occasions at democratic party functions . === death and legacy === in late march <year> , minton was admitted to floyd memorial hospital in new albany , where it was found he was suffering internal bleeding . he died in his sleep early in the morning of april <days> . minton 's wife was roman catholic ; his funeral was held at the now-defunct holy trinity catholic church and was attended by many dignitaries , including several sitting members of the supreme court , the governors of indiana and kentucky , and several members of congress . he was buried in the holy trinity cemetery , on green valley road in new albany , next to leo receveur . minton himself was nominally catholic and had shunned christianity for most of his life ; he only began to occasionally attend mass following his retirement . he left most of his personal papers and judicial records to the truman presidential library.minton is the eponym of the sherman minton bridge , which carries interstate <integer> across the ohio river , connecting western louisville , kentucky with new albany , indiana . minton attended the dedication of the bridge at a <year> ceremony . he is also the namesake of the annual sherman minton moot court competition , held at the indiana university maurer school of law . he is also honored ( with indiana senator homer e. capehart ) —in the `` brutalist '' style designed by woollen , molzan and partners and with architectural art by milton glaser—in the centrally located minton-capehart federal building on indiana world war memorial plaza in indianapolis . a bronze bust of minton was created and put on display in the indiana statehouse.while some writers like linda gugin and legal historian william radcliff have given high praise to minton 's logic in his written opinions , they point out that his positions had little long-term impact . other legal historians , like bernard schwartz , have a more negative opinion of minton 's judicial career . schwartz wrote that minton `` was below mediocrity as a justice . his opinions , relatively few for his tenure , are less than third rate , characterized by their cavalier approach to complicated issues . '' schwartz went on to say , `` he ranks near the bottom of any list of justices . '' most of the precedents minton helped establish were overturned by the warren court in the years immediately following his retirement . in total he wrote sixty-seven majority opinions along with several of the dissenting opinions . gugin authored a work in rebuttal to schwartz 's harsh critique , saying that minton 's rulings were `` predictable based on the principles of deference , precedent , and strict interpretation '' ; she attributed his poor ranking to the bias of reviewers in favor of judicial activism.minton 's time on the court marked the end of a transitory period in the judiciary . since minton , justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court , which has had strong political science implications on the supreme court . the growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in american politics after minton—he was the last member of congress to be appointed to the court . linda gugin and professor james st. clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.minton played an important role behind the scenes of the court as a peacemaker between its two opposing factions . these attempts to keep the peace led justice frankfurter to remark that while minton would never be remembered as a great justice , he would be remembered as a great colleague by his fellow justices . == electoral history == == see also == demographics of the supreme court of the united states list of justices of the supreme court of the united states list of united states

1933.after graduation , she hoped to pursue teaching as a career . however , during the great depression , jobs were difficult to come by and schools wanted to hire teachers who had experience in multiple disciplines . due to the difficulty of finding a job , dewolfe decided to get a graduate degree and , under the advice of joseph grinnell , pursued her phd.after obtaining her bachelor 's degree , dewolfe went on to get her ph.d. in zoology at uc berkeley in 1939.dewolfe was married twice . her first marriage was to nels oakeson from <year> to <year> and her second was to robert

. dewolfe taught until <year> when she became the associate dean of the college of letters and science at uc santa barbara and later in life donated to the uc santa barbara vertebrate museum . == research == dewolfe 's research focused on the white-crowned sparrow . she studied living populations , rather than stuffed animals as was the previous method , in california and alaska . she was observed variations in breeding and song to help determine differences between the races of the sparrow . she focused on three different species of the white-crowned sparrow : the zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis , the z. l. nuttalli , and the z. i. gambelii . the main difference she observed was the z. i. pugetensis migrated while the z. i. nuttalli did not . it was also observed that the z. i. nuttalli showed breeding behavior for six months , went through gonadal recrudescence in december <days> had a slight prenatal molt , did not carry much fat , and had several local song dialects . the z. l. pugetensis showed breeding behavior for four months , did not have breeding size gonads until after mid-april , put on large amounts of fat prior to migration , and had a small number widespread song dialects . her later work on the z. l. gambelii showed it was a long-distance migrating sparrow , had very different breeding distributions , and had no clear geographically structured song dialects . her research on reproduction , song , and historical differences rather than simple physical differences led to the white-crowned sparrow being one of the most researched birds in the world . her research led to over <integer> publications and collaborations with luis baptista and mary erickson.dewolfe received the loye and alden miller research award in <year> for her groundbreaking research into the white-crowned sparrow 's history.during her research , she faced discrimination because she was a woman . her department chair told her , `` we 'll never recommend you for a position for which we have a man available '' and here phd supervisor told her to focus on less difficult work like worms . she experience many other discriminatory instances when searching for a job out of college , such as being refused for job in the national park service because she was a woman . in spite of this discrimination , she was successful as a woman in science and in the field of ornithology . == late life == dewolfe published two autobiographies that reside in the uc santa barbara library , joyous errand ( <year> ) and further recollections ( <year> ) . over the last

chagrin of france , who wanted a french candidate . a compromise was agreed upon ( although publicly denied by all parties ) whereby duisenberg would serve for at least four years , upon which the frenchman jean-claude trichet , director of the banque de france , would take over . in <year> , duisenberg received the vision for europe award in recognition of his efforts toward the unification of europe.during his tenure at the bank , dr. duisenberg was known for his cautious monetary policy and for defending the euro through its early years . he sometimes frustrated investors and politicians by sticking to the bank 's inflation-fighting stance , keeping rates higher than some would have liked . `` i hear , but i do n't listen '' to such pleas , was one of his typically blunt responses . dr. duisenberg repeatedly said it was up to european governments to pursue structural changes such as loosening rigid rules on hiring and firing personnel if they wanted more growth . duisenberg announced he would retire on <integer> july <year> ( his 69th birthday ) , but he remained in office until trichet was cleared of charges of fraud in connection with the collapse of the french bank crédit lyonnais . trichet took over presidency of the ecb on <integer> november <year> . == death == duisenberg died in <year> at the age of <integer> while on vacation at his villa in faucon near

<year> ) was a soviet cosmonaut who , on <integer> august <year> , became the second human to orbit the earth , aboard vostok <integer> , preceded by yuri gagarin on vostok <integer> . he was the fourth person in space , counting suborbital voyages of us astronauts alan shepard and gus grissom . a month short of <integer> years old at launch , he was the youngest person to fly in space until <year> when oliver daemen flew on blue origin <other> at the age of <integer> . since daemen flew a suborbital mission , titov remains the youngest man to fly in earth orbit . titov 's flight finally proved that humans could live and work in space . he was the first person to orbit the earth multiple times ( a total of <integer> ) , the first to pilot a spaceship and to spend more than a day in space . he was also the first to sleep in orbit and to suffer from space sickness ( becoming the first person to vomit in space ) .titov was the first photographer from space : he made the first manual photographs from orbit , thus setting a record for modern first photos of earth from space . he also was the first person to film the earth using a professional quality konvas-avtomat movie camera , which he used for ten minutes.in his subsequent life titov continued to work for the soviet space program , and played a major role in the spiral project where he trained to become the first pilot of an orbital spaceplane . however , after the death of yuri gagarin in a military aircraft accident in <year> , the soviet government decided it could not afford to lose its second cosmonaut , and so titov 's career as test pilot ended . titov served in the soviet air force , attaining the rank of colonel-general . in his final years in post-soviet russia he became a communist politician . despite having been chosen second , after gagarin , to fly into space , it was titov who later proposed the soviet government regularly celebrate cosmonautics day on april <days> , the day of gagarin 's flight . == biography == titov was born in the village of verkhneye zhilino in the altai krai and went to school at the stalingrad military aviation school . after graduating as an air force pilot , he was selected for cosmonaut training in <year> . he flew the vostok <integer> mission launched on <integer> august <year> . it lasted for 25.3 hours and he performed <integer> orbits of the earth . his call sign was eagle ( russian : орёл ) . he landed close to the town of krasny kut in saratov oblast , russia . a month short of <integer> years old at launch , he remained the youngest person to fly in space until july <days> <year> , when his record was surpassed by a dutch teenager , oliver daemen . titov was a member of the communist party of the soviet union , as were almost all the soviet cosmonauts . titov was a fine sportsman , and keen on gymnastics : service in the air force made us strong , both physically and morally . all of us cosmonauts took up sports and pt seriously when we served in the air force . i know that yuri gagarin was fond of ice hockey . he liked to play goal keeper . gherman titov was a gymnastics enthusiast , andriyan nikolayev liked skiing , pavel popovich went in for weight lifting . i do n't think i am wrong when i say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts . he was the first person to suffer from space sickness ( motion sickness in space ) and was also the first person to sleep in space . he slept for roughly one orbit and was surprised to wake with his arms floating in the air because of the absence of normal gravity . he returned to sleep after he had his arms under a security belt and slept <integer> minutes more than predicted by the flight plan . he stated , `` once you have your arms and legs arranged properly , space sleep is fine .... i slept like a baby '' . though he had been suffering from space sickness during his orbit , titov celebrated upon landing . his celebration is described as `` a fit of euphoria '' after landing , and on his return flight to kubishev for debriefing , he alarmed the medical staff by opening and downing a beer , in complete violation of the rules.after landing , titov was sent to hospital for further testing to ensure that he was not sick . after his mission , he reportedly engaged in behaviours that could be considered unacceptable for someone working within the space programme . he is reported to have been enthralled in his love of women , excessive drinking , and fast cars , which caused some to theorise that his behaviour had potentially been another side effect of the space sickness he experienced from zero gravity . further testing revealed that not to be the case.during a widely-publicised <year> visit to seattle to tour the century <integer> world 's fair , titov was asked by reporters how his space flight affected his philosophy of life . he replied : `` sometimes people are saying that god is out there . i was looking around attentively all day but i did n't find anybody there . i saw neither angels nor god '' . the utterance was used in soviet anti-religion propaganda , but it was misattributed to yuri gagarin.following his space flight , titov assumed various senior positions in the soviet space programme until his retirement in <year> . in <year> , he was elected to the state duma as a member of the communist party of the russian federation . he died of cardiac arrest in his sauna at the age of <integer> in moscow . he was buried in the novodevichy cemetery . == awards and legacy == gherman titov was awarded the title hero of the soviet union , two orders of lenin , and numerous medals and foreign orders . he was bestowed the title of the hero of socialist labor of bulgaria , hero of labour of vietnam and hero of mongolia . the titov crater on the far side of the moon and titov island in ha long bay are named after him . on <integer> august <year> , the 50th anniversary of titov 's flight , the reconstructed and expanded gherman titov museum was opened in his native village of polkovnikovo , altai krai.the titov space centre is named after him . == cultural references == in arthur c. clarke 's <year> book , <year> : odyssey two ( and the <year> film adaptation <year> ) , the opening scene features a conversation between dimitri moisevitch of the soviet space council and dr. heywood floyd . when moisevitch informs floyd that the soviets will be travelling to jupiter on their new spaceship , the cosmonaut alexei leonov , floyd is initially puzzled , claiming that he thought the ship was to be named after gherman titov . in the book , moisevitch just mentioned that it had been changed to leonov ; in the film , he replies that titov has fallen out of favour , though he does not elaborate . bbc radio <integer> 's afternoon play on <integer> april <year> , titanium , features titov as narrator during the training and flight of yuri gagarin . it was part of a week to celebrate the 50th

'' == biography == parker grew up in lancaster , pennsylvania and became interested in birdwatching at an early age . in <year> he broke the north american big year record ( seeing more species of birds in a year than anyone before ) . in that year he enrolled at the university of arizona and began to accompany ornithological expeditions to south america , particularly with louisiana state university . he moved to baton rouge and was associated with lsu for the rest of his life ( becoming a fanatical supporter of lsu basketball ) . he supported himself by leading birding tours , especially for victor emanuel nature tours , until the last few years of his life , when he went to work for conservation international . == identification skills == according to zimmer ( <year> ) , `` voice , microhabitat , and behavior are the keys [ to identification ] in neotropical forests , and ted was not only the first to recognize this ( his seminal paper on foliage-gleaner identification that appeared in the april <year> issue of continental birdlife should be required reading for all students of tropical birding ) , but also honed his discrimination of these essential cues to a finer degree than anyone else . '' zimmer adds that as knowledge of these matters was limited , `` [ m ] any field problems… took weeks of patient effort for ted to work out for himself . `` if another ornithologist played parker a tape of an unknown bird , he could usually recognize it and could often identify other species in the background noise . he might then , by his knowledge of bird ranges , state where the tape had been made—zimmer gives the example of `` south bank of the amazon between the rios madeira and tapajos '' .he could identify bird calls and songs even in the presence of many other birds , as when the bird was a member of a mixed-species flock . on more than one occasion , he identified a bird new to him by its call , since he recognized the genus and knew what species lived in the area . once , hearing a recording of a dawn chorus in bolivia , he realized that one of the sounds was an antwren of the genus herpsilochmus—but since he knew all the sounds of those birds , he knew he was hearing a previously unknown species . the following year , the new species was discovered . the scale of this knowledge is given by the presence of over two thousand bird species in the andes and amazon , where parker did most of his field work ; each species typically has at least three vocalizations . he kept them straight not only from each other but from the region 's monkeys , amphibians , and insects as well . == methods == don stap describes parker 's method : walking slowly down a trail , pausing after every step , and watching and listening . in this way he gained his knowledge of both detail and `` common patterns in behavior or vocalizations or community structure across the continent '' , which led jon fjeldså and niels krabbe to call him `` by far the greatest specialist on the life histories of neotropical birds there ever was '' . stap also notes that parker generally did not shoot birds for study , a normal method of field ornithology.when leading tours , parker would lure flocks in by recording their sounds as he heard them and then immediately playing the tape back ; he would predict where the flock would come into sight and arrange his clients to give each a good view . the flock would appear as predicted . == contributions == parker willingly shared his knowledge with others informally , published extensively , and contributed over 10,000 recordings to the macaulay library of natural sounds at the cornell laboratory of ornithology . when he went to work for conservation international , he conceived of an interdisciplinary program to provide scientific information in south america 's conservation crises . this rapid assessment program has led to the creation of many parks and reserves . parker was doing a survey for it in western ecuador when he was killed in a plane crash along with three others , including the botanist alwyn howard gentry . the theodore a. parker iii natural area in lancaster county , pennsylvania , and the parker/gentry award for conservation biology are named for him . == references == == further reading == bancroft , g. thomas and j. v. remsen ( eds . ) ( <year> ) . studies in neotropical ornithology honoring ted parker ( ornithological monographs ) . american ornithologists ' union . isbn <days> maint : extra text : authors list ( link ) according to bates and schulenberg , it contains a complete bibliography and a full memorial . parker , t. a. , iii ( <year> ) . `` an introduction to foliage-gleaner identification '' . continental birdlife . <integer> : 32–37.cs1 maint : multiple names : authors list ( link ) kaufman , kenn ( <year> ) . kingbird highway . houghton miflin . isbn <days> . introduces the young ted parker as a friend of the author and describes some of their mutual birding experiences . illustrates the beginnings of parker 's field techniques and interest in neotropical birds and conservation . wilbur howard duncan ( october <days> , <year> – march <days> , <year> ) was a botany professor at the university of georgia for <integer> years where he oversaw an expansion in the school 's herbarium collection and described three new plant species . duncan also authored several books on plant species of the eastern and southeastern united states . == biography == duncan was born in buffalo , new york , on october <days> , <year> . he received his bachelor 's and master 's degrees , in <year> and <year> , from indiana university , then his phd in botany from duke university in <year> . he then began a forty-year period in the faculty at the university of georgia . as curator of the uga herbarium , he increased the collection size from 16,000 to 135,000 specimens . he personally collected over thirty thousand specimens , which he shared with herbaria across the country.during world war ii , duncan served in the united states public health service , in which he earned the rank of major . his duties during this period included directing mosquito control for charleston , south carolina and serving as state entomologist for kentucky.duncan was married for <integer> years ( from <year> until his death ) to botanist marion bennett duncan , with whom he collaborated on several books , including wildflowers of the eastern united states . == species described == duncan is the botanical authority who first described three plant species : quercus oglethorpensis , trillium persistens , and baptisia arachnifera . all of these species are endangered . == associations and honors == duncan was a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science . == partial bibliography == duncan , w. h. <year> . a new species of oak from georgia . amer . midland naturalist <integer> : 755–756 . duncan , wilbur h.

walther ludwig aschoff ( january <days> , <year> – october <days> , <year> ) was a german physician , biologist and behavioral physiologist . together with erwin bünning and colin pittendrigh , he is considered to be a co-founder of the field of chronobiology.aschoff 's work in the field of chronobiology introduced the idea that shifting one 's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects , such as correlations with mental illness . == life == aschoff was born in freiburg im breisgau as the fifth child of the pathologist ludwig aschoff ( known for discovering the aschoff-tawara or atrioventricular node ) and his wife clara . he grew up in the liberal but morally strict world of prussian academia . after the abitur at a humanistic high school , he – according to his own statement `` lacking a specific interest '' – studied medicine at the university of bonn , where he joined the burschenschaft ( fraternity ) alemannia bonn . aschoff ’ s scientific career began in <year> , when he moved to the university of göttingen to study thermoregulation physiology with hermann rein . in <year> , he received the venia legendi . he then became a professor at the university of göttingen in 1949.in <year> , his mentor , hermann rein , was appointed director of the max planck institute for medical research in heidelberg . rein brought aschoff to the institute as a collaborator to study circadian rhythms in humans , birds , and mice . aschoff then moved to the max planck institute for behavioral physiology in andechs to work with gustav kramer , who showed time-compensated sun-compass navigation in birds , and erich von holst , who studied physiological oscillators . from <year> to <year> , he was a director at the max planck institute for behavioral physiology and an extraordinary professor in munich . aschoff was a scientific member and a member of the kollegiums of the max planck institute for behavior physiology , as well as senator of the max planck society from <year> to <year> . aschoff was known as an excellent lecturer with a booming voice , and he took a special interest in creating a scientific community and encouraging young scientists . after his retirement in <year> and return to freiburg , aschoff continued his scientific work in the form of further publications . only the death of his wife hilde broke his unusual vitality . jürgen aschoff died ten months after his wife in <year> , after a short illness at the age of <integer> years . == work == aschoff provided a strong foundation for the field of chronobiology through his research on circadian rhythms and entrainment in many different organisms such as rats , mice , birds , macaques , monkeys , and humans . his early research focused on understanding the properties of circadian rhythms and how these rhythms can change in response to stimuli . his later work was more applicable to pathologies , such as psychiatric disorders and dangers of shift work schedules , which can result from manipulating specific zeitgebers . aschoff 's work in the field of chronobiology introduced the idea that shifting one 's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects , such as correlations with mental illness . === early work === aschoff began his research on the physiology of thermoregulation by self-experimentation . he discovered that there was a <other> rhythm of variation in body temperature . after these experiments , he began investigating the basic mechanisms of circadian rhythm . in the 1950s , he met and began to collaborate with erwin bünning and colin pittendrigh . aschoff began further experimentation studying the circadian rhythms of birds and mice under constant conditions . his results led to the conclusion that circadian oscillations of biological processes were innate and did not require prior exposure to a <other> day to be expressed.aschoff also applied these methods to experiments with human circadian rhythms by building an underground `` bunker '' to isolate human subjects from any external environmental cues . subjects placed in this bunker were allowed to turn lights on or off according to their own internal rhythms . after over twenty years of tracking sleep-wake cycles , body temperature , urine output , and other physiological and behavioral outputs , aschoff and his collaborator rütger wever concluded that humans have endogenous circadian oscillators . this discovery has become the foundation for our understanding of many medical problems such as aging , sleep disorders , and jet lag.in <year> , aschoff coined the term zeitgeber ( from german for `` time giver '' or `` synchronizer '' ) to refer to external , environmental cues that synchronize an endogenous oscillator to the environmental cycle . to investigate the properties of natural endogenous oscillators , aschoff exposed organisms to constant conditions without zeitgeber cues ( either constant light or constant darkness ) . the observations from this paper were formulated into the fundamental rules of biological clocks . === aschoff 's rule === from the experiments communicated in <year> , aschoff noted that under constant light conditions , the activity phase shortens in nocturnal organisms and lengthens in diurnal organisms . these trends were termed alpha compression and alpha expansion , respectively . in tribute to his mentor , pittendrigh called this observation `` aschoff 's rule '' in a <year> publication , and the designation remains today.aschoff 's rule is related to the model of parametric entrainment , which assumes continuous phase changes . aschoff and pittendrigh approached the field with different models of how oscillators entrain , which resulted in different predictive models . aschoff 's parametric model states that entrainment occurs through gradual changes in the clock that adapt to a new light-dark cycle . although this is no longer recognized as the correct model in the field , serge daan suggested in <year> that aschoff made qualitative contributions that provide valuable alternatives to inconsistencies in the current field . === later work === much of aschoff 's later work involved tests on human subjects . he found that the absence of a light-dark cycle does not prevent humans from entrainment . rather , knowing the time of day from social cues , such as regular meal times , is sufficient for entrainment . aschoff also found that different circadian outputs such as body temperature and locomotor activity can be either internally synchronized or desynchronized depending on the strength of the zeitgeber . in constant darkness , rectal temperature and sleep onset and duration became desynchronized in some subjects , and the rectal temperature at the time of sleep onset was correlated to the duration of the bout of sleep . he hypothesized that internal desynchronization , the phase differences resulting from period differences between two circadian output processes , could be related to many psychiatric disorders.some of aschoff 's later work also integrated his initial interest in thermoregulation with his work on circadian rhythm . he found a circadian rhythm in thermal conductance , a measurement of heat transfer from the body . minimal conductance in mammals and birds oscillates with circadian phase , with a wide range of conductance values . this allows animals to release heat during their activity period , when they have higher basal metabolism , as well as conserve heat during their rest period , when they have lower basal metabolism . in birds , the circadian rhythm in conductance results mostly from circadian rates of evaporative heat loss . in mammals , the conductance oscillates with circadian rhythms in the body 's heat resistance and blood flow rate.following up on his temperature studies , he found that a mammalian species can entrain to a temperature cycle , but that temperature is a weak zeitgeber compared to a light-dark cycle.aschoff described masking signals as inputs that circumvent the pacemaker but nevertheless lead to modulation of a circadian behavior that is also controlled by the pacemaker . parametric entrainment is entrainment that does not result from an instant change in phase , as governed by a phase response curve , as in the case of masking signals . the term aschoff used for this phenomenon is “ arousal ” due to non-photic zeitgebers . data from experimental assays show a relationship between masking effects and phase , leading to a “ demasking ” effect whereby animals arrhythmic in constant conditions have free-running periods in high frequency light-dark cycles . aschoff concluded that the oscillator or circadian clock “ integrates ” over the intensity of light to which it has been exposed , and then responds with a change in the period of activity , as seen in greenfinches , chaffinches , hamsters , and siskins . aschoff concluded , however , that non-parametric effects , as opposed to parametric effects , are the principal source of entrainment . === aschoff–wever model === <integer> ) an increase in the duration of sunset advances the phase of an organism for nocturnal and diurnal animals . <integer> ) an increase in strength of the zeitgeber should increase as sunset duration increases . === influence on other researchers === aschoff has published articles with both pittendrigh and serge daan , the latter also a pivotal researcher in chronobiology . in his recent work , daan has attempted to reconcile the idea of parametric entrainment to light proposed by aschoff with the non-parametric model of entrainment proposed by pittendrigh , and results from a <year> paper from daan 's lab lend further evidence to aschoff 's model of parametric entrainment.although aschoff ’ s collaboration with gustav kramer was never fully realized due to the latter ’ s sudden death , aschoff continued to use birds as model organisms and work with ornithologists . == aschoff 's rule ( prize ) == at a dinner held in aschoff 's honor at the <year> gordon conference on chronobiology , professor till roenneberg initiated the annual giving of the aschoff 's rule prize to scientists who have advanced the field of chronobiology by presenting a plaque with a ruler on it to professor maroli k.

high-efficiency , high-power lasers . he first suggested a system of laser propulsion to launch bulk payloads into orbit , using energy from ground-based lasers to increase exhaust velocity and thereby reduce the propellant-to-payload mass ratio . his concepts on laser propulsion were published in 1988.his early research included supersonic diffusers and supersonic compressors in the early 40s , which has since been applied to jet engines . he invented the total energy variometer in <year> , used in soaring planes , and is the co-inventor of an early scheme for magnetically contained nuclear fusion , patent application , <year> . in <year> , he invented a technique for producing the supersonic source for molecular beams [ <integer> ] ; this was subsequently used by chemists in research that led to two nobel prizes . in the 1960s and 1970s , he led the design and development at aerl of the first intra-aortic balloon pump . the balloon pump is a temporary cardiac assist device which has been used worldwide on three million people . the device was used on his own failing heart . another contribution to science was the stagnation-point flow experiment in which processes of initial interaction of fresh flowing blood with an artificial surface can be directly visualized under a high-power microscope . this technique has become an important method for experimentally studying this vital interaction and led to a variety of circulatory prostheses , including the artificial heart . kantrowitz , as an advocate of the separation of science and technology from political or ideological concerns , first proposed in <year> the creation of an institution for scientific judgment , commonly referred to as the science court , to assess the state of knowledge in scientific controversies of importance to public policy . he further developed the science court as its task force chairman in president ford 's advisory group on anticipated advances in science and technology , 1975–1976 . according to jerry pournelle , `` we could have developed all this [ i.e . large scale commercial space development ] in the 60s and 70s , but we went another path . arthur kantrowitz tried to convince kennedy 's people that the best way to the moon was through development of manned space access , a von braun manned space station , and on to the moon in a logical way that left developed space assets . '' === kantrowitz limit === kantrowitz is known for development of a theoretical concept of fluid choke points at supersonic and near-supersonic inlet velocities . the concept has become known as the kantrowitz limit . ==== technical description ==== ==== applications ==== the kantrowitz limit has many applications in the gas dynamics of inlet flow for jet engines and rockets , both when operating at high-subsonic and supersonic velocities . two examples will explain the effect of the kantrowitz limit on a nozzle . for both cases , mass flow rate = inlet velocity multiplied by area multiplied by density . consider a nozzle connected to a vacuum source . as the pressure ratio gets to about <integer> , the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound , and the flow becomes choked flow . when the absolute pressure of the vacuum is decreased further , the flow speed will not increase . this is the kantrowitz limit , which limits the mass flow because the velocity is limited to the speed of sound , and the area , inlet pressure and density are all fixed . aircraft jet engines are very much affected by this limit , once the inlet flow speed gets to mach <integer> the mass flow rate is limited , regardless of how much suction the engine creates . next , consider the nozzle connected to a compressed air supply . with a pressure ratio of about <integer> , the flow becomes choked , and can not exceed the speed of sound . but the density and resultant mass flow rate can be increased by increasing the inlet pressure . the greater the pressure , the greater the density , and the greater the mass flow . so , while kantrowitz limits the maximum gas velocity , it does not apply any fixed limit to the mass flow rate . a recent high-speed transportation option for rapid transit between populous city-pairs about 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) apart , the hyperloop , has the kantrowitz limit as a fundamental design criterion . attempting to pass a high-speed passenger-pod through a very low pressure tube runs squarely into the kantrowitz fluid flow limit . historically , the solutions to working within the limit have been `` go fast '' and `` go slow '' . a major innovation in the hyperloop proposal provides a novel third approach to remain below the kantrowitz limit while still moving at high-subsonic velocities : adding a front-end inlet compressor to actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the high-speed transport capsule , and thus bypassing much of the air that would have resulted in the dynamic shock of the choked flow . the flow in the smaller duct through the capsule is also subject to the kantrowitz limit , this is relieved by increasing the pressure and the density to achieve the required mass flow . in the hyperloop alpha design of <year> , the air-inlet pump also provides a low-friction air-bearing suspension system for traveling at over <integer> mph ( 1,100 km/h ) . == honors and awards == kantrowitz was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences , american association for the advancement of science , american astronautical society , american institute of aeronautics and astronautics ( honorary ) , american physical society , american institute for medical and biological engineering and member of the national academy of engineering and national academy of sciences and international academy of astronautics . in 1953–1954 , he held both fulbright and guggenheim fellowships at cambridge and manchester universities . kantrowitz was an honorary trustee of the university of rochester , an honorary life member of the board of governors of the technion , and an honorary professor of the huazhong institute of technology , wuhan , china . kantrowitz also served on the board of advisors for the foresight institute , an organization devoted to preparing for nanotechnology . kantrowitz held <integer> patents and wrote or co-authored more than <integer> scientific and professional papers and articles . he also co-authored fundamentals of gas dynamics , <year> , princeton univ . press . kantrowitz died at age <integer> , november <days> , <year> , while visiting relatives in new york . he had suffered a heart attack on the previous day . == see also == hyperloop pod competition – practical ground transport vehicle prototypes dealing with the kantrowitz limit == references == `` biographies of aerospace officials and policymakers , k-n '' . nasa history division . archived from the original on <integer> september <year> . retrieved <days> . johnson , john , jr.

( elementary number theory was already known to be undecidable by gödel 's first incompleteness theorem . ) here is an excerpt from her thesis : '' this consequence of our discussion is interesting because of a result of gödel which shows that the variety of relations between integers ( and operations on integers ) which are arithmetically definable in terms of addition and multiplication of integers is very great . for instance from theorem 3.2 and gödel 's result , we can conclude that the relation which holds between three rationals a , b , and n if and only if n is a positive integer and a=bn is definable in the arithmetic of rationals . '' === hilbert 's tenth problem === hilbert 's tenth problem asks for an algorithm to determine whether a diophantine equation has any solutions in integers . robinson began exploring methods for this problem in <year> while at the rand corporation . her work regarding diophantine representation for exponentiation and her method of using pell 's equation led to the j.r. hypothesis ( named after robinson ) in <year> . proving this hypothesis would be central in the final solution . her research publications would lead to collaborations with martin davis , hilary putnam , and yuri matiyasevich.in <year> , robinson first met martin davis , then an instructor at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign , who was trying to show that all sets with listability property were diophantine in contrast to robinson 's attempt to show that a few special sets — including prime numbers and the powers of <integer> — were diophantine . robinson and davis started collaborating in <year> and were later joined by hilary putnam , they then showed that the solutions to a “ goldilocks ” equation was key to hilbert 's tenth problem.in <year> , the problem was resolved in the negative ; that is , they showed that no such algorithm can exist . through the 1970s , robinson continued working with matiyasevich on one of their solution 's corollaries , which she once stated that there is a constant n such that , given a diophantine equation with any number of parameters and in any number of unknowns , one can effectively transform this equation into another with the same parameters but in only n unknowns such that both equations are solvable or unsolvable for the same values of the parameters . at the time the solution was first published , the authors established n = <integer> . robinson and matiyasevich 's joint work would produce further reduction to <integer> unknowns . === game theory === during the late 1940s , robinson spent a year or so at the rand corporation in santa monica researching game theory . her <year> technical report , `` on the hamiltonian game ( a traveling salesman problem ) , '' is the first publication to use the phrase `` travelling salesman problem '' . shortly thereafter she published a paper called `` an iterative method of solving a game '' in 1951. : <integer> in her paper , she proved that the fictitious play dynamics converges to the mixed strategy nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games . this was posed by george w. brown as a prize problem at rand corporation . : <integer> == professorship at uc berkeley == robinson was not allowed to teach in the mathematics department at berkeley after marrying raphael m. robinson in <year> , as there was a rule which prevented family members from working together in the same department . robinson then instead stayed in the statistics department despite wanting to teach calculus . although raphael retired in <year> , it was n't until <year> she was offered a full-time professorship position at berkeley after the department heard of her nomination to the national academy of sciences . == honors == after robinson solved hilbert 's tenth problem , saunders mac lane nominated her for the national academy of sciences . alfred tarski and jerzy neyman also flew out to washington , d.c. to further explain to the nas why her work is so important and how it tremendously contributed to mathematics . in <year> , she was the first female mathematician to be elected to the national academy of sciences . robinson was elected the first female president of the american mathematical society . it took time for her to accept the nomination , stated in her autobiography : '' in <year> i was nominated for the presidency of the american mathematical society . i realized that i had been chosen because i was a woman and because i had the seal of approval , as it were , of the national academy . after discussion with raphael , who thought i should decline and save my energy for mathematics , and other members of my family , who differed with him , i decided that as a woman and a mathematician i had no alternative but to accept . i have always tried to do everything i could to encourage talented women to become research mathematicians . i found my service as president of the society taxing but very , very satisfying . '' in <year> , robinson was given the noether award through the association for women in mathematics and did a lecture series called functional equations in arithmetic . around this time she also was given the macarthur fellowship prize of $ 60,000 . in <year> , she also became a member of the american academy of arts and sciences . == political work == in the 1950s robinson was active in local democratic party activities . she was alan cranston 's campaign manager in contra costa county when he ran for his first political office , state controller . `` i don ’ t remember exactly what happened , but the end result was that julia involved herself during those years in the nitty-gritty of democratic party politics—she registered voters , stuffed envelopes , rang door- bells in neighborhoods where people expected to be paid for their vote . she even served as alan cranston ’ s campaign manager for contra costa county when he successfully ran for state controller—his first political office . '' robinson was also a volunteer for adlai stevenson ’ s presidential campaigns . == death and legacy == in <year> , robinson was diagnosed with leukemia , and she died in oakland , california , on july <days> , <year> . `` one of julia ’ s last requests was that there be no funeral service and that those wishing to make a gift in her memory contribute to the alfred tarski fund , which she had been instrumental in setting up in honor of her late teacher , friend , and colleague . modest to the end , she let her character and achievements speak for themselves . '' the julia robinson mathematics festival sponsored by the american institute of mathematics 2013–present and by the mathematical sciences research institute , 2007–2013 , was named in her honor . george csicsery produced and directed a one-hour documentary about robinson titled julia robinson and hilbert 's tenth problem , that premiered at the joint mathematics meeting in san diego on january <days> , <year> . notices of the american mathematical society printed a film review and an interview with the director . the college mathematics journal also published a film review . == notes == davis , martin ( 1970–1980 ) . `` robinson , julia bowman '' . dictionary of scientific biography . <integer> . new york : charles scribner 's sons . pp . 265–268 . isbn <days> . feferman , solomon , ed .

mathematics genealogy project julia bowman robinson on the internet ( mirror ) trailer for julia robinson and hilbert 's tenth problem on youtube erich apel ( <integer> october <year> – <integer> december <year> ) worked during world war two as a rocket engineer at the peenemünde army research center in nazi germany . after his return from the soviet union where he had forcibly worked for rocketry development under the operation osoaviakhim until <year> he became an east german party official . during the later 1950s , he was increasingly involved in economic policy , serving from <year> as head of the politburo 's economics commission . he was seen as a reformer . however , economic reform rapidly fell off the agenda after october <year> when nikita khrushchev fell from power in moscow.apel served as president of the state planning commission between <year> and <year> . his final project was to negotiate a trade deal with the soviet union . however , hours before he was due to sign the resulting agreement on behalf of the east german government , he committed suicide by firearm . == life == === early years === erich hans apel was born in judenbach , a small town in the franconian forest which had once benefited from its position as a staging post on a major trade route , but which had lost out commercially following the construction of a railway line providing a direct link from leipzig to nuremberg . apel 's father was a mechanical engineer : his mother worked in the garments industry . he attended school in nearby sonneberg and steinach , but left school in <year> in order to embark on an apprenticeship at the neuhaus porcelain factory in toolmaking and mechanical engineering . the ruling nazi party was popular in the region and in <year> he joined the deutsches jungvolk youth organisation . however , it was found that the sixteen year old disrupted the `` mind-numbingly dull drill exercises '' ( `` der stumpfsinnige drill '' ) , and he was thrown out after nine months because of his `` negative attitude '' to the quasi-military exercises in which the boys were expected to participate . after completing his apprenticeship in <year> he stayed on at the neuhaus factory as a toolmaker and designer till <year> . then , between <year> and <year> , he attended the engineering academy at nearby ilmenau , emerging with a degree in mechanical engineering . === war years === directly after receiving his degree , <days> september <year> apel was conscripted into the army , becoming a member of infantry reserve battalion <integer> , based in gotha . around this time world war ii broke out . however , on <integer> december <year> apel was ordered to the weapons agency 's research facility at peenemünde on germany 's northern coast . the head of the facility was the charismatic rocketry expert , wernher von braun . apel seems to have been in his element . a contemporary later recalled that he worked from 07.30 till 17.30 , like everyone else , but then in the evenings he retreated to his bedroom in a nearby hostel , in order to work on proposals for improvements . his speciality was the hydraulic systems for the rockets . he was tireless in his work of calculation , measuring and modelling . he seems to have made a good impression , since <days> august <year> he was relieved of all further obligations regarding military service . <days> november <year> he was appointed to the position of plant engineer and assistant to the facility director . he was totally uninterested in politics , never joining the party , and regarded by colleagues as a dedicated engineer , body and soul.3 october <year> was apel 's twenty-fifth birthday . coincidentally , he was able to spent the day as a witness to the first launch anywhere in the world of a long-distance rocket , the so-called ( at this stage ) a4 . the launch took place at 16.00 and everything worked perfectly , the rocket attaining a speed of mach 4.5 , a height of <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) , and a horizontal distance of <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) . at the start of <year> apel was promoted again , despite his young age becoming head of one of the many development departments at the peenemünde army research facility . shortly after this he mentioned to as group of colleagues what a wretched business it was that the thing should explode in the middle of a city . his boss , walter thiel , came to hear of the comment and called him aside , `` apel , you should have joined the medical service : you 're too soft for the work here '' . however , there is no indication that apel 's comment adversely affected his career prospects : the researchers at peenemünde saw themselves as an elite team engaged in vital work , and the only realistic alternative career path would have led him back to the military frontline.during <year> it became clear that the british knew about the research facility at peenemünde . with their us allies they launched a succession of bombing raids to destroy it , starting <days> august <year> . most of the <integer> people killed at peenemünde in the first bombing raid , on <integer> august <days> were forced labourers , but the dead also included erich apel 's boss , walter thiel and his family . by that time , however , apel himself was far away , transferred <days> april <year> with his own team of assembly specialists and administrators to the linke-hofmann-werke ( lhw ) plant in breslau ( as wrocław was known ) before <year> ) . breslau was traditionally a centre for railway production and lhw was traditionally a manufacturer of railway locomotives and rolling stock , but during the war its sophisticated engineering capabilities were also being adapted to produce components and sub-assemblies for the rocket , which government propaganda was by now identifying as the `` vergeltungswaffe <integer> '' ( `` retribution weapon <integer> '' / <other> ) . as the continuing bombing raids at the peenemünde army research center had their effect through <year> and <year> , the lhw plant became the assembly location for the <other> rockets . in <integer> april <year> , at the request of the lhw management , erich apel was released from his employment contract with the army high command weapons agency . he was now employed directly as chief engineer and assistant to the technical director at lhw.by the end of <year> the war was coming home to germany . lhw now outsourced <other> rocket production to a firm called `` peterbau gmbh '' in kleinbodungen near nordhausen . with the assembly contract they sent erich apel , who with effect from january <year> became technical director of peterbau gmbh . apel 's resolute determination to avoid politics now seemed to catch up with him , since the new location for rocket assembly was part of the vast underground factory at the mittelbau-dora concentration camp . conditions were so dreadful that at least one commentator has suggested that the <other> rockets found more victims among the slave labourers engaged in constructing the underground factory and in working on the rockets than among the citizens of london , the intended target of the finished rockets . even if erich apel had nothing to do with setting up and running the vast deadly forced labour infrastructure , as the engineer responsible for the rockets he was naturally associated with it . as nazi germany collapsed militarily and politically during the first part of <year> , apel succeeded in getting back to his home village of judenbach . like millions of his compatriots he was determined to make a clean break with the past . === soviet occupation zone === war ended , formally , <days> may <year> . the entire southern region of germany had been liberated by the united states army , but the victorious powers had already agreed a partition of the western two thirds of the country into four military occupation zones . after the americans had withdrawn to their agreed positions judenbach was included in the middle portion of germany that would now be administered as the soviet occupation zone . initially apel worked on the local farms . on <integer> january <year> he enrolled on the `` new teachers '' programme . with millions of working age germans dead or in prison of war camps , there was a desperate shortage of teachers , and the scheme , implemented with varying levels of effectiveness in the various occupation zones , was designed to select those appropriately educated individuals who were thought to be not excessively tainted by nazi involvement , to undergo a rapid `` re-education '' and set to work educating school-age children . at the same time he both studied and taught , till <integer> may <year> , at the professional business academy in nearby steinach.in january <year> erich apel joined a political party , choosing the centre-left social democratic party ( `` sozialdemokratische partei deutschlands '' / spd ) . four months later , the spd merged with the communist party to form the new socialist unity party ( `` sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands '' / sed ) . the merger was presented as a way to prevent divisions on the political left from opening up opportunities for right wing populists to take control as had happened after <year> . in reality it never took effect except in the soviet zone , where it received sustained practical backing from the military administration . the political development was not one for which apel could muster much enthusiasm , and in common with many spd members he was not one of those `` volunteering '' to sign his party membership over to the new party ( though he was accepted as a member of the sed , eleven years later , in <year> ) . === work in the soviet union === on <integer> june <year> apel was `` picked up '' by the soviet authorities . they showed no interest in his association with forced labour at the underground rocket factory at mittelbau-dora . but they were nevertheless interested in the factory ; and they did make him an offer which , for a range of practical reasons , he was almost certainly in no position to refuse . the soviets invited him to work with them as chief engineer and representative of the ( former ) factory management at the soviet technical commission in the bleicherode quarter of nordhausen ( which had also ended up in the soviet zone ) , adjacent to the vast underground rocket plant.soviet interest in the german rocket programme was fully shared by the united states . during the chaotic closing weeks of the war wernher von braun had traveled to nordhausen and met with apel , offering to take him to america after the military defeat which by now everyone saw as inevitable . von braun was keen , as far as possible , to keep his full team with him . but his specialist in rocket hydraulics turned him down . apel did not want to volunteer for further work in the weapons industry.on <integer> october <year> , across the soviet occupation zone , in the early hours of the morning technicians and engineers from the rocket project were visited by soviet officers , each accompanied by a translator . a brief instruction was read out : `` by order of the soviet military administration you must work for five years in the soviet union . you can take your wife and family with you , and as many of your personal effects as you wish ... '' . till now apel 's working life had involved living in guest houses or barracks so he did not have many personal effects . just hours after the order was given apel and his colleagues were on the train heading east as part of operation osoaviakhim . the mood on the train was dark and apprehensive . the journey took around <integer> days . their ultimate destination was an island in the middle of lake seliger in a sparsely inhabited marshy region some <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) northwest of moscow.before crossing to the island apel was taken to podlipki ( today korolyov ) where he was reunited with a large quantity of heavy machinery and equipment that he had last seen in germany during the closing weeks of the war . the german invasion of the soviet union in <year> had forced the soviets to build up an impressive expertise in deconstructing factories and their equipment , crating them up , and relocating them by train to places beyond the reach of the german army . after the war they had taken the opportunity to perfect their skills , crating up surviving german factories and their equipment , and taking them to the soviet union by way of war reparations . the <year> opel kadett turned up in <year> as the soviet built moskvitch <integer> . they had also applied their skill to the rocket facility in the mountain . the red army had used <integer> railway wagons to carry away 5,647 tonnes of machinery , munitions , and partially constructed rockets . by the end of <year> a further 2,270 railway wagons had transported another 14,256 rocket construction plant , partially constructed rockets , and specialist machinery from the former nazi facility in the soviet occupation zone to a new rocket research facility in the soviet union . secrecy was so complete that ten years later the world still believed that soviet rocket programme was based on soviet rocket science . the americans had taken away only <integer> tonnes of `` rocket materials '' from the nordhausen facility . after inspecting the soviet hoard , erich apel joined his colleagues on the island of gorodomlya.keeping the german workers on an island helped enforce the secrecy , but the german experts nevertheless received wages twice as high as those of their soviet counterparts . erich apel became head of a testing department . seventy years later a colleague from those times remembered him as `` sociable , but also a little distant . not so proletarian , and always a bit 'the boss ' '' ( `` '' er war gesellig , aber auch ein bisschen distanziert . nicht so proletenhaft , immer auch ein bisschen 'der chef ' '' ) . there was no attempt to integrate the germans into the soviet research teams . stalin never intended that they should remain permanently . the idea was to `` milk '' their knowledge till their soviet counterparts had absorbed all the necessary knowledge . that point was reached by the end of <year> , after which the germans on the island were restricted to `` theoretical '' research . that suited apel well enough . he had found a new wife , christa metzner , the daughter of a german aircraft engineer from the arado aircraft plant. , whom he married in gorodomlya . information on his first marriage remains in short supply : christa apel said later that she believed erich had married an austrian woman around <year> , but the first marriage had ended in divorce because apel 's war work meant he was almost always away . it was frequently indicated that during his six years in the soviet union erich apel became a communist , but in his bones it seems reasonable to conclude that he remained a political agnostic . === german democratic republic === erich apel returned on <integer> june <year> . the soviet occupation zone had been relaunched <days> october <year> as the soviet sponsored german democratic republic ( east germany ) . there was no call , in east germany , for specialist expertise in weapons and rocketry . other branches of heavy industry remained in place , however . just four months after getting back , erich apel was working as a chief engineer and department head at the east german ministry for machinery construction . promotion to a technical directorship followed <days> april <year> . <days> november <year> he became a deputy minister in the department , working under heinrich rau.he owed his rapid advancement in the new state to its leader , walter ulbricht . after years under military occupation which in many ways placed soviet well-being ahead of german reconstruction , ulbricht had narrowly survived the <year> uprising and was now keen to demonstrate that under soviet sponsorship it was possible to create in east germany a fully functioning socialist state . for that he needed technical experts and talented administrators . apel was both . an important political ally and sponsor was fritz selbmann . after his six years in the soviet union , apel ( like selbmann ) , was a convinced proponent of a `` planned economy '' . the choice was one between `` rationalty '' ( vernunft ) and `` chaos '' . it was already apparent that in west germany free market capitalism was giving rise to far more rapid economic growth than anything happening in east germany . the lesson to be drawn was that economic planning had to be undertaken competently and in microscopic detail by the government . political leadership was needed.in june <year> , already a junior government minister , apel became a candidate for party membership . membership was granted <days> march <year> . slightly more than one year later , <days> july <year> , he became a candidate for central committee membership . <days> july <year> erich apel became one of approximately <integer> members of the powerful party central committee . under the leninist constitutional structure in place , the central committee exercised a far tighter degree of control than government ministers or the national parliament ( volkskammer ) . it was therefore by most reckoning a promotion when on <integer> february <year> erich apel resigned his ministerial position and accepted a position as head of the newly created economic commission of the central committee 's politburo . in <year> he also became a member of the volkskammer , in which capacity he chaired the parliamentary economic committee.the economic challenges facing east germany were already formidable by <year> . the mandate walter ulbricht gave to the new economic commission was summed up in the mantra which the leader liked to repeat . east germany should `` overtake without catching up '' ( `` überholen ohne einzuholen '' ) . east germans must be able to eat more butter and meat than west germans . one day they must be able to travel in faster cars and live in better apartments . this must be accomplished without having to copy `` capitalist production methods '' . erich apel must make it happen , not `` someday ... never '' , but by creating and following a plan . if it was a dream , it was a dream in which many comrades evidently believed . <days> july <year> apel was promoted to candidate membership of the politburo and secretaryship of the central committee . there were other appointments which combined to stress his importance in the wider government project . in <year> he received a doctorate in return for a dissertation on the so-called east german chemistry programme.the `` chemistry programme '' was a seven-year plan , launched in <year> under the widely communicated motto `` chemistry gives us bread , welfare and beauty '' ( `` chemie gibt brot , wohlstand und schönheit '' ) , and designed to double chemicals production by <year> , making it the country 's second largest industrial sector after mechanical engineering . the project was closely identified with erich apel , whose intellectual brilliance marked him , and the project , out for success . but reality got in the way of the targets . reparations extracted by the soviets had bled the country of its capacity to rebuild and maintain the infrastructure necessary to support the east german government 's economic aspirations . cut off by international political rivalries from western and world markets , the nation continued to be dependent on deliveries of vital raw materials from the soviet union , and the partnership with the soviets , even at the height of the cold war , was far less fraternal than would have been assumed at the time in the west . recently discovered documents indicate that even in <year> moscow agreed to deliver to the german democratic republic only around half the raw materials which the east german economic plan for <other> called for . one solution was to try and select trading partners according to commercial criteria and not purely according to political dogma . the economic blockade dividing east germany from the west was largely self-imposed : between <year> and <year> apel was able to oversee a modest trend whereby the proportion of east germany 's foreign trade with west rose from <integer> % to <integer> % of the total . but more than half of the country 's trade was reported in <year> to be with the soviet union , conducted on terms favourable to moscow and disadvantageous to east germany , applying set prices that were well below `` world market prices '' , both for exports and for imports.in <year> otto grotewohl and willi stoph took over as chairman of the council of ministers . at the time there were some who saw stoph as walter ulbricht 's heir apparent . a level of rivalry within the party central committee was normal , but between apel and stoph there quickly emerged a particularly intense mutual antagonism . to the extent that both men were responsible for delivering a better future for the people there was an inherent overlap between their public profiles . stoph never missed a chance to highlight a failure to meet planned objectives or to criticise apel 's actions and utterances . pressure also increased from moscow where nikita khrushchev fell from power <days> october <year> . leonid brezhnev , the new party secretary in moscow , condemned his predecessor 's `` failures of economic leadership '' . there were a number of rapid practical changes . soviet wheat deliveries to east germany planned for <year> were cut back to 400,000 tonnes , a third of the annual quantity in existing plans . within the east german leadership apel had always been able to count on backing for his reforms from walter ulbricht , but the changes in moscow meant that ulbricht 's driving priority had was now to secure his own position . back <days> january <year> ulbricht had stunned colleagues , under the influence of apel , announcing a <other> reversal on economic policy . `` we need economics to trump politics '' ( `` wir brauchen ein primat der ökonomie über die politik ! '' ) . there was talk of revitalising the market and allowing private trade - subject to a restrictive framework - and of moving society away from a semi-military footing towards a civil one . that had been in <year> , before the fall of khrushchev . but now the leader was ready for another <integer> degree reversal over economic policy.on <integer> december <year> erich apel was due to sign a new economic agreement with the soviet union covering the period <other> . earlier that year he had traveled to moscow with walter ulbricht to finalise the terms . apel was not in favour of signing the agreement that the comrades in moscow had imposed , but he had been opposed by alfred neumann , chairman of the people 's economic council and a moscow loyalist . more importantly , he had been over-ruled by walter ulbricht . early that morning the telephone rang in apel 's office at the ministry in east berlin . willi stoph wanted a word . there was no reply . erich apel , while seated at his desk , had taken his own life . a 7.65 mm bullet from his service pistol lay at his feet . the east german signature on the trade deal with the soviets would be that of alfred neumann . news of apel 's death was held back till after the soviet signatory , trade minister nikolai patolichev had left town , later that day.there were those who believed erich apel had been murdered , in the context of an increasingly intense power struggle between politburo members as walter ulbricht 's period in power was seen to be coming to an end . ulbricht himself ordered the ministry for state security to investigate apel 's death , though later commentators found the aspects of the investigation `` uncharacteristically sloppy '' . on the other hand , west berlin 's mayor , willy brandt was never in doubt that erich apel 's death had been a suicide , performed in protest over the soviet union 's continuing exploitation of east germany . brandt reacted with a cryptic prophesy : `` he did not die quietly . we will all hear from him again , from what it was that made him do it .

zoological explorations in tibet served as a cover for his role in the german secret service . he was also a scientific member in the ahnenerbe and held the rank of an ss-sturmbannführer . == early life == schäfer was born in cologne , and even as a young boy , he spent time in the outdoors shooting with an air gun and rearing birds , insects and reptiles . after high school ( abitur <year> from mannheim ) , he worked at vogelwarten in denmark and heligoland . he then joined the university of göttingen and studied zoology , botany and geology . he was a fan of the swedish geographer sven hedin . he met hugo weigold on a study trip to helgoland , which led him to join weigold and american brooke dolan ii from the philadelphia academy of sciences to china in 1930–31 . he published berge , buddhas und bären ( mountains , buddhas and bears ) in <year> , based on the trip and gained wide recognition . in <year> , dolan invited schäfer for a second trip into tibet in <year> , which

his studies of the birds of tibet . schäfer joined the schutzstaffel in <year> but , after world war ii , he claimed to have been an unwilling recruit who joined only to advance his scientific career . == expedition == in <year> , he was appointed untersturmführer in the personal staff , and in <year> he was promoted to sturmbannführer . he led the third expedition to tibet in 1938–39 under the patronage of heinrich himmler , the ss , and various sponsors . as many as 3,300 bird specimens were collected in these expeditions . a film was produced on the expedition titled geheimnis tibet ( secret tibet ) . himmler was personally interested in the project due to various pet pseudo-scientific theories that he subscribed to including ideas such as human origins , and hanns hörbiger 's welteislehre ( `` world ice theory '' ) .in july <year> , during his second expedition in asia , he met the then exiled panchen lama , thubten chökyi nyima , at a mountain temple near hangzhou , china . he describes the lama as a kindly , sympathetic man who enquired about how far germany was and whether he had been waylaid by any robbers on the way.the ss ahnenerbe expedition to tibet during the 1930s was also successful for the german naturalists `` meanwhile , ernst schäfer and bruno beger , edmund geer and krause carefully packed up the voluminous natural history collection- animal and bird skins ; butterflies , bees , ants , wasps and other insect specimens ; fragile dried plants for the herbarium ; packets of seeds containing one thousand , six hundred varieties of barley , seven hundred varieties of wheat , and seven hundred varieties of oats ; not to mention hundreds of seeds from other potentially useful plants . `` : <integer> these seeds collected during the tibetan expeditions were important , as heinrich himmler planned to develop hardy new varieties of crops in order to boost the agricultural yields of colonies across the eastern territories of the ukraine and crimea . himmler ordered the ahnenerbe to found a teaching and research institute in plant genetics , assigning the task to dr. ernst schäfer , who he found to be an ideal young german zoologist who could also lead the tibet expedition . schäfer set to work with characteristic vigor . he obtained a staff of seven research scientists , including a british prisoner of war , and set up an experimental research station in lannach , near the city of graz in austria . there the new institute went to work , experimenting with samples of grains that schäfer had acquired from the granaries of the tibetan nobility . : <integer> a statue in a german private collection which has come to be called the `` iron man '' is speculated to have been obtained by ernst schäfer during the tibet expedition in <year> as part of the tibet mission that was supported by himmler . there is no proof that this was indeed obtained during the expedition but it has been a subject of considerable speculation . analysis showed that it was made from iron of meteoric origin , specifically of an ataxite class , an extremely rare type , of meteorite and possibly carved from a piece of the chinga meteorite . the statue is believed to portray the god vaisravana . speculation that it belongs to the pre-buddhist bon culture that existed in asia about 1,000 years ago has been brought into question due to certain incoherent features of clothing and style.in <year> , schäfer was awarded the war merit cross , 2nd class with swords . he was made an honorary member of the german ornithologists

<days> , <year> , lund ) was a swedish geographer . he is known for his work on migration , cultural diffusion and time geography . a native and resident of sweden , hägerstrand was a professor ( later professor emeritus ) of geography at lund university , where he received his doctorate in <year> . his doctoral research was on cultural diffusion . his research has helped to make sweden , and particularly lund , a major center of innovative work in cultural geography . he also influenced the practice of spatial planning in sweden through his students . == early life == hägerstrand 's father was a teacher at a remote elementary school and the family lived at the school . hägerstrand recalled that his early education was based on the pedagogical ideas of swiss educator johann pestalozzi . several of hägerstrand 's students speculated that his holistic and visionary thinking was rooted in his early education : he was taught local geography , history and folklore at home in the pestalozzi tradition which was being introduced at that time . cartography , geology , botany and agronomy were all interrelated parts of a more holistic understanding of processes within a spatial area . to start with , children learned about their immediate environment ( e.g. , the school room and the farm ) , then about the village , and gradually the whole district . as a pupil of hägerstrand , it is easy for me to recognize parts of this tradition which later became what we today would refer to as an 'integrative perspective ' . == academic career == hägerstrand entered lund university in <year> . his <year> doctoral thesis innovation diffusion as a spatial process gained fame for its innovative use of monte carlo simulation of demographic development . it showed how dynamic , incremental simulation of spatial processes could be used at the spatial scale of the individual as well as large spatial aggregates . forty years later , geographer andrew cliff remarked on the foresight of hägerstrand 's methodology : `` bearing in mind that much of the research upon which the book is based dates from a time when computers were almost nonexistent , let alone used by geographers , it is remarkable that the simulation methodology which is so critically dependent upon computing power should have been contemplated . `` hägerstrand 's research was aided by developments at lund university , notably the establishment of the siffermaskinen i lund ( smil ) , one of sweden 's first computers . hägerstrand noted that the swedish computer scientist carl-erik fröberg , who had been hägerstrand 's `` school-mate since secondary school '' , had introduced him to the monte carlo method that would define his doctoral thesis , following a trip by fröberg and other young swedish scientists to the united states , a trip that was financed by the swedish government 's project to build its own computer.in <year> , he presented a paper titled `` what about people in regional science ? '' to the european congress of the regional science association in copenhagen , denmark . this paper , published in <year> , developed two concepts : the need to study the individual in order to understand social and group practices . modern cultural geographers commonly now study everyday practices on an individualistic basis , in order to understand larger scale patterns . the study of just groups creates a homogenization of reality and hides the truth . a link between space and time that had previously been poorly developed . historically , social scientists had treated time as a relevant but external factor to spatial features . hägerstrand 's early work on innovation diffusion ( studying the geographical spread of new technologies ) made him realise that the two , though separate , were not independent of each other ; they have what french theorist henri lefebvre would call a dialectical relationship . == legacy == hägerstrand 's initial work was primarily quantitative , which is important as the discipline of geography was , when he published his first paper in <year> , a highly descriptive subject . in the 1950s he was a pioneer of geocoding statistical primary data . he developed models and statistical techniques , such as the time–space cube and time–space prism , which later became important in the development of geographic information systems that process and visualize movement data . his work informed the likes of allan pred and nigel thrift , who helped take it to the english speaking world.hägerstrand 's work contributed to the introduction of humanistic thought into geography , which led to the development of critical geography . while his early work was largely quantitative , hägerstrand 's later work paid closer attention to notions of embodiment and emotion . still , his methods were critiqued by feminist geographer gillian rose , who claimed that his models showed a masculine and falsely-ordered view of the world . more recent geographers have tried to combine time geography with the qualitative research and affective phenomenology of feminist geography . development of hägerstrand 's work has continued to form part of the basis for non-representational theory , and a reappraisal of his work by new generations of social scientists and biologists means that he remains an influential thinker today . in <year> , nigel thrift summarized five benefits of hägerstrand 's time geography for contemporary social science : first , it provides a sense of concreteness , of the power of 'thereness ' , and it does so in a way—visually—that is still the preserve of too few social theorists . all those intricate diagrams were , in part , an attempt to describe the pragmatics of events , a theme which has now , in the work of writers like deleuze , become fashionable in the social sciences and humanities but , at the time at which hägerstrand was working , tended to be restricted to the field of philosophy , except for the work of social interactionists and ethnomethodologists which was often very imperfectly understood by other than a relatively small coterie of enthusiasts . secondly , hägerstrand 's work was an attack on the durkheimian idea that space and time were social categories , collective representations which both derived from society and also dictated to society . [ ... ] time-geography makes it possible to go beyond social constructionism by emphasizing the physical constraints on human action and the wider networks of competing opportunities that they set up which act to steer situations . [ ... ] thirdly , and as a directly related point , those time-geographic diagrams did something else too . they radically lessened the distinction between humans and other objects . they provided a kind of neutrality of representation , even a democracy of description , of the world .
